Came with a friend last week for lunch. For the lunch special, they offer 2 rolls for $9.50 and 3 rolls for $12.50. We ordered a few rolls with a waitress who takes my order the majority of times when I go. After we finished a different waitress from the one who took our order came over asking if we would like anything else. Still hungry, we order another roll. When we got the check we were charged for 2-2 roll lunch specials and full price for the third roll. We called over another server asking why I was getting charged full price while it still during lunch hours (lunch special from 11:30 am-3pm if I'm not mistaken) the waiter told me because I ordered with a different server and because I didn't order everything all at once was the reason why I was getting charged full price for the third roll. This made no sense to me, I would understand if I was getting it to go or if it was after the lunch special but it wasn't.. it was around 1:30 pm. The waitress with the dog tattoo on her hand (who was the original server) came over and started getting loud with me so I asked to speak to a manager. \"He's not in today\" of course he isn't. I asked her to show me in writing where it says I have to order everything all at once and she didn't of course, continued to tell me there was no way to change the check and it's my fault I didn't order everything at one. How is it my fault that 2 other servers besides herself came over asking if we would like anything else and it's not uncommon for someone to order another roll.. The original waitress walked away CALLING ME CRAZY might I add. Which then pushed me over the edge. She went over to speak to someone else who worked there who I guess told her to change the check to the 1 of the 2 roll lunch special, and 1-3 roll lunch special. Which I was happy about.

THAT WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT . I walked into the restaurant which was pretty empty and had to wait pretty long to get a table . when we got seated before even looking at the menu we were asked if we were ready to order . I asked for more time and the rude gentleman serving us looked at me like I had 6 heads & walked away . I decided to ignore it . he came back maybe 2 minutes and 30 seconds later with warm water and asked again if I knew what I wanted . mind you I haven't even had a chance to read half the menu . I asked him once again for another minute and he huffed and puffed . before he left the table he sarcastically asked \"is there anything you want now?\" so I took the offer and asked him for a lot of lemon for my water . he came back with 1 lemon slice .. as if me and two other people were supposed to share it . \u00a0he got fed up with the fact that I had asked for more lemons and stormed off \u00a0. I guess he had gotten fed up with the fact that he had to do his job so he sent another waitress to serve us . when we gave our orders to her my clearly spoken words were obviously not enough because we all had to repeat our orders 3 times . she came back shortly before our food was served to pour us more warm water with no lemons & poured water all over my friends phone , she clearly noticed that her phone was wet and just walked away . than when we wanted to pay the bill we asked for separate checks and I guess that was a problem because she had to stand there and stare at me for a good 20 seconds . she than said that the credit card minimum was 10 dollars so I ended up paying for my friend . overall I would not return ."}, {"date": "3/28/2016", "star": 4.0, "review": "Love this place!!!

The place was practically empty, and the music, though current (which I'm not a fan of--old soul here), was generally relaxing.The service is good.First, I had the merlot. It was pretty basic.My family and I had an appetizer of fried calamari. It was very buttery. This made it quite delectable. I am usually not a fan of everything-deep-fried, but this time it was quite good. The diced onions was a cute touch.Then I ordered the honey walnut chicken and shrimp as the entree. I saw that it was recommended here on Yelp. The shrimp was fried HEAVILY in batter, which was disappointing. It was also garnished in some kind of mayonnaise sauce, which was equally disappointing. I didn't really enjoy it. In terms of the chicken, it was decent. The sauce was sweet but all too similar to a General Tso's sauce. A tad on the goopy side. The walnuts were fresh. I declined having the rice--no need for the extra carb!I guess it is just a generally nice dining option. The atmosphere is really nice. I give this place a 4 because the food is pretty basic.

As far as the entr\u00e9es, I've had the sesame chicken with brown rice but I believe you have the option of white rice. Not too much breading and the chicken is nice and juicy.

My boyfriend and I used to order from them every few weeks (via Seamless), anything from sushi to thai meals. We enjoyed it well enough (thus the 2 stars instead of 1).Then one night, they screwed up part of our order. No big deal - they gave us regular rolls instead of hand rolls. Normally we wouldn't complain, but after having paid $30 and waited 45 minutes, we thought we deserved what we asked for. So, I called them and explained. The woman who answered was absolutely fine about it - she acknowledged the mistake, but asked if we'd like the manager to come over with the correct hand rolls. I thought this was slightly suspicious - it was asked as if we were inconveniencing them. I said that we did, and she said the manager would come over.Now, they had packed our sushi together - meaning the 3 incorrect rolls were in the same package as 1 that was correct. They were sitting out on our coffee table for 20 minutes, when the manager came. Before giving us the correct order, he ASKED FOR OUR SUSHI BACK. Raw fish, which had been sitting on our table, which we now had to handle ourselves in order to give back to him. He refused to give us our correct order, until he received his incorrect sushi back.What he did with the incorrect order, is beyond me. If he was just going to throw it out, why not let us keep it? They were the ones who were wrong in the first place. I had no problem proving that it was the wrong order, but for him to take it back was the cheapest move I have ever seen. Not to mention - he can't legally give that food to someone else. But given that he had taken it back, we can only assume that it was to try to sell it to someone else. We now assume that whatever food we had previously eaten from there, just may have been sitting in someone else's living room for 20 minutes.

Bayside has an ample selection for asian cuisine, in many different scopes that an admit-tingly ABC* individual such as my self can not say has too much history with because it's just not necessarily the flavor that i grew up on and wholeheartedly enjoy. I dont have a comprehensive knowledge about it, but I know a thing or two. But the neomodern dishes I was fortunate enough to come across has considerably changed my level of interest about the cuisine of my culture and the ones that are associated with it. I choose the expression neomodern because fusion does not describe how well the menu caters to fans and non fans of this style of food. They had shrimp siu mai dishes that you can compete with the catacombs of chinatown dim sum to braised lamb chops that would make you think you were on the outskirts of some ethereal town in Australia. We also did try a few special rolls as well. the sensation roll with its coconut pangko eel, lobster salad, prepared naruto style ( cucumber outside no rice) and strawberry garnish and mango salsa.... breakfast lunch dinner and dessert baby. We mistakingly also ordered the coconut pangKo eel roll, but it was hell of a mistake. althought it was prepared only slightly different from the sensation, it still served as a much different but just as delectable decision. just the alteration of proportion in ingredients, and that honey cottage cheese drizzle... sounds weird right? nawwww, it was slammin'!the next time we went back they hooked us up with the take out menu which had been expanded. they said tey were beginning to offer it in the dining room but physically didnt have the menus... we arent so stuck up that we didnt wanna order off the flimsier take out menu so they let us rock. they also referred to us as the fortunate ones who were first to experience the menu... that was probably less than true, but regardless, looking around, didnt see anyone with the new menu. still we only tried the blue crab tartare that was available on the old menu but was new to us. let me capslock this so no one misses reading this. BEST DISH I HAVE EVER HAD. we tried the chilean sea bass. i came in an orange miso glaze that even though it did not need to, did \u00a0wonderful job of accentuating the quality of fish. that was one freaking tasty piece of bass, let me tell you! I should also mention that the bar was empty, which was great for us cuz we waited literally seconds for our lychee figtinee and pimm's cup cocktails to arrive, but too bad for them, but i guess more folks just needed to hear about this place instead of hitting up those dingy muscle head bars down on bell, reeking in axe, desperation, and whatever jersey shore fan-esque stereotypes.The appearance is to be honest quite loud, but in a dissonantly harmonious way. Definitely a strong feature that distinguishes it from many other restaurants in this neighborhood and many more.... i dont know why someone said there was upstairs seating... its a shame but its untrue. regardless the decor alone invites all different demographics, whether it be families with 2.5 kids to satisfy to folks trying to go on a memorable date. But what draws people back I'd imagine for dinners besides special occasions was the service and food. Were the prices higher than most other restaurants? Yes. But by how much? maybe one or two bucks, and three to five more for larger portioned dishes. So if you ask me, is that a reasonable price for a wonderful experience?

I left absolutely disgusted last night. I can not believe a place that treats people like pure scum is still in business. Last night me and a group of my friends (one guy and two girls) decided we wanted to go smoke hookah. We head to Steinway simply because there are about 10 different hookah spots on one long block. Crystal's music sounded decent so we decided to try there. Just so happens a person was pulling out of a spot close to the place. As my male friend starts to pull into the spot, a car pulls up on the other side of the street (heading in the opposite direction) and says that's his spot and the guy was saving it for him so move. Mind you,he said this very nasty and was raising his voice. FOR NO REASON. I say for no reason because we were letting him have the spot anyway. My friend simply said you don't have to raise your voice, and the little angry man in the car continued to go off as we pulled away to find another spot.We find another spot 20 minutes later walk up to Crystal Lounge only to find the same little nasty man at the door. He takes one of my female friends id and says she need to provide another id because its out of state, as he proceed to look through her wallet. He decides to let her pass him, and my male friend is next to hand over his id. He looks down at his id and steps to him and says \"you were the one talking all that sh*t in the car. You ain't getting in here.\" So at first naturally we all think this man is joking because one all my friend did as tell him not to raise his voice, two we let him have the parking spot, and three no way a bouncer would turn away four people because of a parking spot dispute that technically he had with HIMSELF. He then proceeds to step to my male friend like he wanted to fight. I mean yelling, cursing, and threatening him. So I ask to speak to the manager. He then proceeds to tell me that he is the bouncer, the Manager, and JESUS. Yes, you read that right, he referred to himself as Jesus. So I ask again, the other bouncer points to another guy that was standing there watching the whole situation go down from the beginning. That observer was THE MANAGER. I could not believe it, especially being a business professional myself. The manager proceeds to tell us that he going to go with whatever the little angry bouncer man said, and that we should just go because it's not worth it. Again, yes, you read that correctly THE MANAGER said that. I was baffled. So I'm like your right, see you on YELP (as I realized I should've checked Yelp before I even attempted to deal with the ignorance at this place). It was at this moment the same little bouncer man with the dreads decided he wanted to start cursing at me, a female. Like literally cursing at me like he wanted to fight. Again, I'm a female. When my male friend defends me, he proceeds to threaten my male friend and tells him to watch his back because he owns this block, all of this as a group of guys walk up into the situation (people the bouncer knew who were apparently there to handle my friend). Not wanting this to get uglier than it already was, I grabbed my friend and pulled him away from the escalating situation. All while the bouncer is screaming threats down the block. I was in shock. I am still in shock. I know this is a long review, but I felt it was necessary to explain the whole situation so you can see how this place is run. I have never been treated like that at any other establishment I've ever attended IN MY LIFE. I don't even write Yelp review, this is my first one, but it was absolutely necessary. What type of establishment let's a bouncer take out his petty imaginary beef on paying customers? What type of business lets a man that curses women out represent them? What type of manager stands there and watches the whole scene play out? What type of hookah bar lets the people that represent them threaten customers? Yesterday I was shocked, today I woke up utterly DISGUSTED. This bouncer that MULTIPLE yelp posts have mentioned, has to go. In case I wasn't clear on which bouncer enticed all this drama, it was the short one with the dreads. He should not be allowed to work anywhere that allows him to interact with people. I can just conclude this by saying spare yourself the headache, and the insults and take your money to one of the other ten plus hookah spots on Steinway. The people are horrible and judging by the other reviews the place is just trash in general. Hope my review spares you guys from having a night like I had last night."}, {"date": "2/21/2017", "star": 1.0, "review": "This place is absolute trash, customer service is non existent.

My experience has been based on a Friday or Saturday night . Maybe they treat others differently from Monday -Thursday .Go at your own will ideally for my birthday i was going to go to khan lounge which is next door. due to the fact that every time i end up at crystal's me and my group are always asked to move from the table because they need the chairs when it starts getting crowded. but \u00a0i decided to give it another chance because this time i was getting bottle service package with my group which he offered for 200 bucks as a \"deal\" ( which is not a deal because honestly that's around what the price is. so break down is 180 for the bottle and 2 regular plain hookah for 10 bucks each but i let him think that sureeee that's a deal ) \u00a0everything was all fine , until of course people started to come in. well it was semi fine. the waitress or bartender is superrrrrrr annoying. upon walking in. why are you so thirsty for me to let you know what i'm going to order. like can i take off my coat and look at this menu here in the dark before i tell you what i want. like damnnnn.anyways as it got crowded they started eyeing the table. my group finished the bottle, but we were there still smoking on our hookahs. this man took away both hookah's , the empty bottle. and the other hookah that i paid out of my pocket with and said there is a time limit and you guys finished the drinks so yeah im sorry that's the rule. this was all around 1240pm i guarantee you all they little crews in there don't have a time limit !maybe you guys should have a disclaimer, there's limited seating or something because i just paid to enjoy my bday for 1 hour ,bro. come onummmmm what about the hookah i paid for that wasn't included in your \u00a0package. why couldn't you just move us to the back or tell us you need the seats for bottle service like you do every time?all in all  they have good music, good drinks.they will kick you out once it gets crowded as all the yelp reviews saidsecurity guard as all of the yelp review said is rude ( the one with the dreads)this place will learn that customer service goes a longggggggggg way !!!!"}, {"date": "1/22/2017", "star": 1.0, "review": "Can I give this review no stars? I left upset last night. I came in with my best friend when there was about 10/12 people were in the establishment. We were served promptly. No issues. It started to get packed and noticed the server eyeing my table often. Yes we weren't ordering more than our drinks and hookah because we were just pacing ourselves- we could have easily bought 2/3 more drinks each but again we were chilling and pacing. I even told my friend, I bet she wants us to leave since she kept eyeing our table. So guess what happens, she brings us our check. Um we weren't done, our hookah still have plenty of life left. I didn't say anything- just took my card out and dropped it in with the receipt. She tells us it's cash only- um wouldn't you think to tell us that when we arrived? I go to the ATM upfront which only dispenses $60 at a time.... um what's up with that? The server tells my friend that we can move to the bar because there's patrons that bought a bottle or something of that sort that they need this table. I'm sorry that was incredibly rude. I am in the hospitality industry to know that's what NOT to do. Sorry, I am not STANDING at the bar with my hookah. I am a customer who is paying and was willing to purchase more. The bill included gratuity which I wasn't happy with. And honestly, I'd like a refund or at least partial. That is NOT how you treat your guests. That party would have to wait until the next table was available. I truly left livid. I felt that I shouldn't have paid. I would not recommend this lounge. Suggestions: work on your customer service.

Had I taken the time to go through the reviews on yelp, I would have saved myself from THE WORST SERVICE EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE!!!!! If you do NOT want to have a horrible time and have to pay a lot of money for it, save yourself the trouble and don't go to Crystal Lounge in Astoria! Our group of about 8 people \"had\" to buy a bottle to be seated! After we got our bottle and our plastic cups, the server paid very little to no attention to us. I should mention that this is a \"cash only\" place and you HAVE to pay the bill in advance. We had 2 other people join our group one hour later, we paid for a second bottle so they didn't have to pay the cover fee. At one point, our \"lovely\" server passed by our table 4 times as we were calling him and flat out ignored us. My friend had to stand up from his seat and wave at him to get his attention. This was his response \"calm down dude, you and your other friend need to chill, I got you\" with hand gestures and all. And no, he did not \"get us.\" As we were trying to look pass the service issues and enjoy ourselves - after all, we paid $400 for two bottles already, two bouncers came from outside and told us we had to leave because \"our time was up.\" Mind you, this was less than 1 hour after we ordered the second bottled which was still 3/4 of the way full. Of course our lovely server and other bussers proceeded to clear our table without giving us an explanation. I had it by that point and did not want to argue because honestly we weren't even having fun so we decided to leave. This place deserves a - 5 star review. If you are the owner of this place and you happen to read your reviews, fire your rude and useless staff.

She came back with an attitude saying to hurry up that she needs to close the table and go home. She walked away and everytime i looked at her she would laugh and start dancing. We left the money and walked out. I asked multiple employees for her name and they wouldn't tell me because ridiculous TONY clearly runs this place on fear. When i told him what happened he laughingly \u00a0said, \"well thats not that bad\". At the same time she came running out because she knew I was gonna say something.

He makes some kind of insult of where they from, and says that NY is better (my friends didn't laugh at his rude joke). Some girl stepped out of the lounge (probably staff), he rudely tells her to go back inside, she said she needed to breathe fresh air, he tells her to catch a breather inside. Curses her out saying \"stupid black bitch\", turn around and apologize to us for witnessing that. Than he says but it's ok he can say racist things because he's black, but we can't because we're not black. (The whole time we didn't say anything, but our faces in shock says plenty). He lets us in this little outdoor cubicle where another promoter tells us to get in is $200 for a bottle and 2 hookahs on the house. We questioned him, than he says we can get in and have hookah and drinks at the bar standing up. We walk towards the very narrow space to the bar, we order a round of tequila shots and a hookah. In the time we were waiting for drinks, we noticed the group that was behind us outside was seated by the bar, no bottles, hookah and drinks arrived before ours. We also noticed everyone seated didn't have bottles except for 1 group. As we also waited we had to press ourselves to the bar to avoid getting burnt from the traffic of hookahs being ordered, and traffic of everyone getting to and from the bathroom. We got our simple shots w/ lime no salt, and I told the bartender to cancel the hookah. Paid $92 for 7 shots. The 2nd promoter kept harassing 1 of my Canadian friends trying to make her feel stupid for buying shots when we could have paid for a bottle. At that point I was ready to leave, and than a hookah guy comes to give us our hookah. I told him I cancelled it, the bartender says its on the house. I told her I didn't want it because of their horrible service and space. We left immediately to get a breathe of fresh air indeed. Every staff we've encountered were complete assholes, felt bad for the black girl who got insulted in front of everyone. I was embarrassed my out-of-town friends had to endure this. We ended up going to Sultana Lounge, who's service was 100x better, staff & space was nicer, DJ was awesome, and spent our $200 on a bottle with 2 free hookahs.

The food was prepared fresh and came out quickly. We had the meat platter with Doro Wat, Gomen, Ater Kik Alicha, and Tibs Alicha. The most disappointing thing right off the bat is that the Doro Wat in the platter does not come with a hard boiled egg. I added it on for an extra cost but was put off by the exclusion of a traditional part of the dish. It would be like having a big mac but the onions and special sauce are an add on. Over all, the food was pretty good and the platter for three people was appropriately sized for the three of us.

I was entertaining my partner's wishes by trying it again.The food came family style, and it again reminded me of South-Asian type cuisine - stews/curries and a bread-like substance. We got the three person family meal with chicken and beef. I can't describe the individual dishes to you because they all started mashing together after a while, even in terms of flavour. What I do remember was that it was an extra $2 for an egg to make the chicken \"authentic\", whatever that meant.Overall, I wish I could write more about the food, but alas that intimates my opinion of it - it wasn't anything memorable. Perhaps it's Ethiopian cuisine itself, but I felt like the flavours weren't strong enough to draw me in and have me coming back again and again.

It didn't hurt that it looked like a monsoon had hit NYC outside.The restaurant was pretty big, split into 2 dining rooms, but they only had 1 open. It was dimly-lit and very intimate inside. Since we were the only customers at the time, we were greeted immediately and presented menus.For an appetizer, we ordered the Avocado salad, which came with rolled up Injera bread. For those not in the know, Injera bread is a sourdough-risen flatbread with a spongy texture. The Avocado salad comprised of diced avocados, tomatoes, jalapenos, onions and some lime. The salad was very fresh and went so well with the sourdough bread. Although it was really good, at the end of the day it was Avocado salad so take that for what it's worth.Since we were a table of 6, our table shared 2 large plates of entrees. When I say large, I mean VERY VERY large plates! Our main course consisted of a hodgepodge of beef, lamb and chicken with vegetable sides. We ordered the Special Kitfo beef, Yebeg Alicha lamb, Doro Wat chicken and Awash chicken. To be honest, all of the food meshed together and it was very good overall. There was not 1 dish I didn't like. Although it wasn't the best, the one that stood out the most was the Doro Wat because of its spicyness. It had a really mean kick to it --- in a good way.For drinks, we had 2 bottles of honey wine because it was that damn good! The wine was very sweet, but was an excellent compliment to our meal.I really liked the intimacy of the restaurant and the fact that it wasn't loud inside. My coworkers and I were able to have conversations without having to scream across the table. The service was also good as the waitress kept coming by to refill our water constantly.

They provide a lot of injera bread for you on the side to pick up the veggies and meat. The injera bread has a soft chewy texture with a lightly sour fermented flavor. When mixed with the spicy meat and vegetables, it was a contrasting blend of flavors.

We came here on a Friday night with a reservation for 8:30. We showed up right before 8:30 and the hostess told us to have a seat in the lounge / bar area because it would be a few minutes before we could be seated. She told us they were still preparing the table. Twenty or so minutes later, we were a bit confused and asked the hostess again when our table would be ready. She apologized and said she would ask and get back to us and never got back to us. At this point we had been waiting for over a half hour and we tried asked someone else how much longer it would be; at this point we were very frustrated. This was the second person who told us she would \"ask\" and never returned to us with an answer. After 45 minutes of waiting, we asked to see a manager and complained about how we had asked multiple people for time updates only to be completely ignored. It almost seemed as if the people we had asked earlier were purposefully avoiding us. It took a reservation, 50 additional minutes of waiting, conversations with multiple hostesses, a lot of complaining, and a request speak to the manager until we were seated. Once seated, the manager finally came to speak to us and offered our party of 3 champagne and apologized. This did not at all really make up for the long wait and rudeness we had experienced from the hostesses. To be fair, the food was very good, although a bit on the pricey side. We ordered two plates of steamed dim sum (one vegetarian and one with seafood options), the Crispy Silver Cod, the Chilean Sea Bass, and an order of Egg and Scallion fried rice. We were happy with the meal. When we were finished eating, we began conversing with The table right next to us who was complaining as well about how horrible the service had been. They too, along with at least 5 other parties we had witnessed, had been forced to wait 40+ minutes despite having a reservation. We were not the only party who had been extremely frustrated and disappointed with the horrible service we had dealt with at the beginning of the evening. Our waitress was friendly and our dining experience was good, although the table next to us noted that they were seated 5 minutes after us and by the time we had finished eating they had still not been served.

Apparently, it's United Airlines, American, Frontier Airlines, and TAO who are into this.) And yes, you'll pay for a little of that internal decor with the pricing and not-great P2P (price to portions) ratio.So why a #MERLINFIVE? Two words: THE PEKING DUCK (not counting the article there). The stuff is perfectly sliced, with just the right mix of fatty and lean pieces and skins. No hair on the skin, which is a problem with cheap crispy duck. Pancakes are abundant, and they don't skim, unlike a lot of places. And P2P on it is excellent. You will blow the bank, but it's one of the few things where you won't regret it.Other good dishes: fried dumplings, dim sum sampler, and sichaun tofu. They're great, but P2P is \"problematic.\" Still, I'm giving this place a #MerlinFIVE because the duck is THAT good.Skip desserts and go to Junior's.

We both ordered the dim sum platter as our appetizer, which came with three different types of dumplings. They tasted different than what I would normally eat at dim sum, aside from the shrimp dumpling. The presentation was nice.Next, I ordered the chicken in a clay pot while my friend ordered a vegetarian chicken dish. Both were great! The chicken in a clay pot was a bit too sweet, but it tasted good. It had a Thai twist to it with the basil. The vegetarian chicken dish tasted exactly like chicken! However, the snap peas were a bit raw. Some people like their snap peas raw though. Our entrees came with a side of bok Choi which was really good.For dessert, we had the option of a tropical dish or sorbet. My friend and I ordered one each. The sorbet was well, sorbet. Nothing exciting. But the tropical dessert was very delicious, mixing coconut sorbet and coconut whipped cream with orange jelly almost. Quite a refreshing taste. The service was good. It did take them a little while before taking our orders, but for the most part everyone was very friendly. They did not let me pay with ApplePay but I understand that restaurants are not that up-to-date with their tech.This was definitely a fun experience.

Don't be a hero, use the spoon and not the chopsticks because they will fall apart. \u00a0They were all great, but shrimp shumai was the best. The Hakkasan fried dim sum was incredibly filling but so glad we got it. One was like a granulated shrimp filled empanada. The other was shaped like a pumpkin and had bean paste. The third had the best fried crust ever. I have no idea what was in it. The Prawn Toast has tails that dissolve in your mouth. I really love shrimp, so more granulated shrimp is a good thing. I tasted the foie gras in some bites -was super subtle. My absolute favorite dish was the Crispy Prawn. The best granulated shrimp deep fried and breaded ever in best duck sauce ever. Should make four for easier sharing, it came with three and the top edible branches are pretty. It make it hard to share. \u00a0The Soft shell crab is interesting, it stays hot, the stuff around it has nuts and curry and a fuzzy texture. No actual shell. I'm not going to lie, by the time it came out I was getting full. The black pepper ribeye is buttery soft, has a lot of garlic and curry in it and the cellophane noodle shell was good. The Egg and onion rice was not outstanding, but when mixed with the black pepper ribeye and the soft shell crab fuzzy stuff the tastes complemented each other well. For dessert I tried the Passion fruit. It's actually a piece of small chocolate cake with passion fruit in it, on top of it, and next to it. It also came with some sort of ice cream. Each item separately was great, but together not amazing. As for service, the waiter aimed to please and was patient with us. The manager greeted us and checked in with us which was respectful.

We waited way too long to get seated 1 hr with a reservation. I was unaware that this wait was a part of the restraunt experience as our unapoligetic waiter kindly enlightened me. As part of this restaurant experience they like to let you sit alone and wait for along time without any contact as not to disturb you as you find your pre-meal Zen. \u00a0Usually I welcome Waiter advice at a new restaurant, but when I said no multiple times, I was glad he informed me that my order was incorrect and that he knew what I should order. See another part of the experience is that some parts of the menu are just there for a joke. Luckily if you accidently pick the joke items the waiter will kindly direct you to the real items on the menu. If this guessing part excites you please stop reading now because I am about to tell you how to read the menu sans guessing. If you look at any item under $26, those are all joke items and you will quickly learn that if you accidently ask for it. Another great aspect is that you dont know for sure what part of your orders you will get. So even if you follow the \u00a0golden rule, you still get a surprise based on whether or not your food comes at all. All in all It was delicious, but the headgames became tedious. The \u00a0rest of the service was great besides some of the corrections we recieved and the extra waiting.

A seemingly unsuspecting door on a dark random street, when you first walk into the restaurant you realize you are visiting somewhere special. A white long hallway leads you to the hostess who will then revel the enormous, well-lit space decorate minimally but very tastefully. The menu, Asian, is expansive and will have a multitude of options for vegetarians, pescaterians, and meat-eaters. I recommend the dumpling appetizers, spring rice, and vegetarian chicken. Definitely try the floating goddess drink as well. One con is that service is slow. The restaurant is understaff so expect to wait for your food and definitely for your drinks (I always tell the people I'm with to order their next drink when they are half-way through their current drink because that's how long it takes to arrive). The restaurant is on the pricier side- expect to spend at least $50 per person for dinner and a drink. Also, good for large groups.

They should have trained their staff better; most of them don't speak English. Our white waiter (the bald young guy) snuck up on me, whispering in my ear, startling me each time. And when I turned around to face him, he didn't step back, just got in my face staring at me, a bit creepy. He had no concept of respecting personal space. Don't get me started on the food. The steamed dumplings were so overcooked they came out soggy, yuk. We tried almost everything except that overpriced Peking duck with caviar (almost almost $300).

However, there were too many botches and inconsistencies that made what would otherwise have been a fantastic dining experience feel below average.The food was definitely above average; I especially recommend the Peking Duck. But, at $88 for just this dish, and the high prices overall, I expect exemplary service which you will not get here. For these prices, you can do a lot better. For example, we observed:- Lack of knowledge or recommendations about menu items - Both of our menus were dirty with bits of food and smudges- Very long 25 minute+ wait between courses- Sake cups removed when more than half of the flask had remaining sake- Ordered dessert wine alongside dessert which did not arrive until well after dessert was finished; apology was given that there was only one person handling the wine, which is unacceptable given the size of this restaurant.- Sake was listed on the menu with the serving temperature (cold/room/warm). After I put in my order, after waiting a while someone came back to ask what temperature I wanted it at.- Service was generally not attentive when it came to drink refills - wine/sake glasses were never refilled and- Not my direct experience, but worth noting that 2 tables adjacent to me had to send food back for combing out cold. The ladies sitting at the table next to me had to send back 2 dishes.It may sound like nitpicking, but keep in mind we paid $170/person for our food and drinks for 2 people. This is simply NOT the upscale dining experience you deserve for shelling out this kind of money. To summarize, the service is not polished and detracts from the overall experience. It makes the whole Michelin rating system come into question. The best description I found among Yelp reviews for this place which I agree with is that it is an upscale PF Chang's.

A real nice night out. Here it's just a dimly lit Chinese restaurant with a Times Square tourist crowd. Very disappointing. 2. Pace of meal. Awful. We arrived and had a drink at bar. Good cocktails. Seated at 7.45pm and ordered right away. Our appetizer arrived within 10 mins, very tasty. Then a full 50 mins before the rest of the food!!! It arrived at 8.50pm!!! We were almost ready to just up and leave, but kept being reassured \"your entree is coming, your entree is coming...\". Finally the dishes arrived and apart from the spicy shrimp being cold, was tasty.3. Screw up with the payment. The waiters were attentive and nice. However, when we paid they brought out a credit card slip with somebody's (more expensive) dinner charged to my card!!! I pointed this out and no apologies, they just responded casually\" oh it's wrong\" and they re-ran my card for our correct amount, without giving me any slip showing a reversal, just \"oh, you should see the correction on your credit card on Monday\". Very amateurish and not what you'd expect for a $200 dinner for two. So apart from the food being tasty (if expensive but that was to be expected) the ambience and inept service killed it for me.

At one point there were two empty tables next to each other, which my boyfriend asked if we could be seated there so that we can put the tables together and the host told us no. Instead she sat an individual there, when there were two tables one two being cleared by the window. At another point the host asked another group of four that were seated at table for six to move to the side to make room for us, and then proceeded to add two more chairs. She then comes to us and asks if we want to to sit with another group, to which we obviously declined. Who wants to be squeezed into another table with a group that was made to move for you? We tried to wait a while longer, but when the host again proceeded to sit another group we were fed up and decided to leave.

Tater tots are always tasty, but the shredded pork and the marinade they use is really good. My boy got the fired calamari, and normally I'm hesitant about fish from anywhere other than a seafood restaurant, but Brewski's got it right. Wings were just as good too. Entree wise the waffle-wich is everything. It's chicken and waffles and the tenderness/crispiness balance was just right. Portion size was solid, and you could tell that Brewski's emphasizes quality.

Four star because i wish there was more of a variety of music... maybe oldie's to song requests maybe even karaoke/singalong nights. 2. There is an outdoor area for those that want to smoke a cigarette and an indoor area. There is a bouncer at the front door and to the door leading to the outdoor area. Both places have enough tables and chairs to host their guests in.3. BAR FOOD was to die for, especially their pouting. Wings were amazing too and their tater tots, chili, etc. Reasonable prices for the food... nothing crazy expensive and nothing crazy cheap either. 4. Drinks!!! Meathead served us and man he is one awesome, cool dude. He explained everything to my husband and I on our first time there, showed us where the restroom was etc and this was around 10pm but he made time to show us around which we really appreciated. We weren't served any bottom shelf liquor, never woke up feeling like death or so.. Never had to wait long to be served and receive drinks. They do have an ATM inside which came in really helpful since one time we went towards the end of the night the credit card machine was acting up. Don't be fooled by their long island ice tea!

Now the music itself was good, but the place is not large and the speakers were literally in front of us, making it really hard to carry a conversation. \u00a0If the music was a little lower it would had been a good vibe. We asked to be moved to the front part of the room.Service: \u00a0This is really where they lost most of their points. The hostess was genuinely nice but it was weird that she asked if we wanted to sit outside when it was 40 degrees and drizzling. The rest of the staff was all over the place. The manager needs to do a better job at delegating and assigning task/sections of the restaurant to each staff. \u00a0For example, the guy behind the counter was also playing the role of a waiter and busboy making it difficult for him to finish other task and provide the best customer service to those eating on the bakery side. \u00a0Two ladies who were seating on the table we were waiting for had to get up and demand their change because this gentleman was so busy he forgot. \u00a0She told me had she was never returning back due to the service. \u00a0Once we were finally seated, my boyfriend asked for a beer and was given one to him without being opened, luckily, he used this keys to open it. I asked for mayo and was given hot sauce instead. Everyone who worked there seemed confused as to what they were supposed to do and there was minimal communication between staff.Food: While waiting to be seated we got a croissant and it was buttery. \u00a0We then had the turkey burger, chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict and all the food was pretty tasty. We got some dessert (caramel cake, fruit tart and round chocolate) to go and I can honestly say it \u00a0was all quite good.This place has potential to be a 4-5 restaurant but they really need to bring a consultant or Gordon Ramsey from Hell's Kitchen to improve their efficiency.If I return it will be to get items from the bakery TO GO."}, {"date": "3/25/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "We had a great time at Lenox Saphire.

This place is small, hidden, and a bit shady but the food is great! Fujianese cuisine is known for its inexpensive price tag and decent amount of food to share. There are many varieties of food on the menu. For breakfast, I love the Fujianese Wonton Soup. Fujianese-style wontons are smaller and more about the wonton skin. Soup base is more vinegary than savory. It is a great appetizer to start off with any time of the day. Taro Toast is triangular shaped and fried, just pure excellence when it is still scorching hot. The classic Fujianese Peanut Noodle is really great here. Peanut buttery and the noodles are soft. Try it!For lunch and dinner, I love their vermicelli. Their vermicelli noodle dishes can come with soup or stir-fry with pork, chicken, or clams. They all come with cabbage and a generous amount of meat and vermicelli.

The blue is for ESL students, the green for sesame chicken orderers; obviously blue is the more intriguing one to me. Lets do some menuology: I spent an hour cross referencing the two menus finding differences. For one, the green menu has lunch specials and combination platters. Makes me think Americans like to order by number. There are other differences: The sections are different. On the green menu, you have sections for Egg Foo Young, Lo Mein, Fried Rice and the descriptive Diet with Nature Flavor. The green menu is also seperated into chicken, pork, and beef while the blue menu ONLY has a section with the all-encompassing title \"MEAT\". Elsewhere in blue living, you get the Special Appetizers section, Stew Soup, and the my favorite section of all: OTHER. At first I thought this was naive, but now I think they are just being considerate. Americans differentiate meats. We are concerned with things like \"diets\" - we need big letter descriptions.Misspellings and far out items prove legitimacy to me. Let's take a few samples from the menu:AppertizersClam Bamboo SoupZesty Intestine in Hot PotSweet Soy Bean MilkPork Blood with Califlower Over RicePork Lung, any styleSauteed Jelly Fish HeadLive Giant Crab Any Style (wait, Live? like living?

But they are awfully stingy with it. The rack of lamb was a bit undercooked. We asked for medium but it was definitely more on the side or rare of medium rare. We ordered the Lava cake for dessert and this is where they kinda flopped. The lava cake was overcooked to the point where the chocolate ganache was more gel than runny. And the service was schizophrenic. The food came out too fast... Four dishes were out before we could finish our salad and then the rack of lamb didn't come out till we'd finished all our plates and came up with a plan to overthrown the government of a small country.

I've had Tin Marin Bookmarked, ever since my friend Charles L., visited and raved about it. Crowded house and only 2 seats waiting for us at the bar a little past midnight. We grabbed them quick with a nice side view of local band, 'La Rosa'- who jammed and belted out Doo-Wop, Reggae and Pop songs with their own, Soul and Funk rhythm. We happened to be in Riverdale, at the right time and the right place!  My girl, Colleen, aka, 'La Rubia', tended the bar like a whip in hand. Considering it was past midnight, I particularly loved that Tin Marin offers an extensive, 'Late-Night Menu'. The Bread & Garlic dipping sauce was terrific and La Rubia hooked me up with more carbs. My Tapas of thinly sliced Octopus, was fabulous and my Shrimp in Passion Fruit Sauce had all the right elements: salty, sweet and spicy- but missed a true Passion Fruit taste- they were still edible! According to Mr. Man, both his Chorizo & Tostones were great as were his Pinchos (skewers) of Shrimp, Chicken & Beef.Tin Marin is not huge, but their menu highly makes up, tenfold.

Our second \"app\" was an entree size portion of the mushroom ravioli for the table...Oh.My.God. I MAY have licked the plate clean. The brown butter cream sauce with fried sage was such a typically amazing compliment to the earthy hen of the wood mushrooms. The pasta was light and perfectly cooked. Not one bad thing to say.

We all devoured this, asked for more bread and wanted to stick our fingers in the serving dish to make sure every single bit was eaten. \u00a0Their seasonings complimented the liver beautifully. They didn't try to hide the natural flavor with too much \"stuff\" ,which happens a lot with a liver mousse. Entrees: Pork chop, pork chop, pork chop. This thing is HUGE. they could probably charge double for it and i would still get it. The dish is smokey from the grilled radicchio, the pork is tender and perfectly cooked and the polenta is so so so creamy. it's a perfect combo and i finished the entire thing and only gave my husband one bite. it was too good to share.

The burger. A good burger is hard to find sometimes with places overcooking the meat, having a small burger patty or a bun that falls to pieces after the first bit. Mayfield does burgers right! The patty has to be over 8 oz its pretty darn big! It always comes out perfectly cooked, medium rare for me. I always pay the extra $2 for bacon and a fried egg which takes the burger to the next level for me. The other solid part of the burger is a great tasting bun that stays together and absorbs all the juicy meat goodness without falling apart. The burger is served with fresh cut fries or a salad. Despite how good the burger itself is my favorite part is the pickles which come in the side!!!

The mignonette sauce is at the right level of acidity and adds great flavor to the oysters. 2) The chicken liver pate (Whenever I have a bad meal, I always think back to how delicious the pate is here) The slices of toast are crunchy and warm, and it helps melt the fat on the chicken liver. I also love how they have a small fresh arugula salad on the side. 3) Mushroom ravioli- (it comes in two sizes: small/large) and it's some of the best pasta I've ever had.

This server is great at selling but if someone seems hesitant about tongue--you should probably suggest another meal. On another occasion I ordered two coffees.

I ordered the House Corned Beef Tongue Hash.QualityI was in New York City for the weekend so I was following the lead of my buddies for all food selections. On Saturday afternoon my friend suggested that we try out Mayfield for brunch. It was a bit later in the day so I figured I would be ordering lunch, but as soon as I saw the House Corned Beef Tongue Hash, I knew that would be my selection. A mix of tender meat, potatoes, and veggies with two poached eggs on top, a mustard hollandaise, and rye toast created a delicious mixture. I was not sure how I would feel about the mustard hollandaise, but it turned out to be pretty amazing. The highlight of the meal though was dragging the rye toast through the remains of the bowl and soaking up the delicious juices. I will say that my friend ordered the Patty Melt and I must admit that made me feel like I made the wrong selection.QuantityThe House Corned Beef Tongue Hash comes in a good sized bowl with two pieces of toast on the side. I came in hungry though and I definitely felt like I could have used a side dish to go along with it.ValueAll the prices on the menu seemed pretty reasonable. My dish was about $15, which may be a little high for a breakfast dish, but the unique flavors make it worth that extra few dollars.AmbianceMayfield is located in Brooklyn in an area known as Prospect Heights. Compared to the nearby businesses it has a much more hip and modern feel. Inside you can tell they left much of the original design in place. Red brick and white tiles line the walls and a beautiful wooden floor give it a cool feel. The inside area stretches longways with an open kitchen towards the back and a bar area in the center. It also seemed like that had a small outdoor patio open in the back. They were playing a great mix of indie rock music in the background, which really matched the vibe of the restaurant. Everything was great except the fact that it was unbelievably hot inside. At first we were seated towards the back and we assumed that the heat was coming from the kitchen. We ended up moving closer to the front, where we learned it was actually just obnoxiously hot throughout the entire restaurant. It honestly was hard to enjoy a meal and conversation because of the heat, and the room temperature water didn't help at all either.CrowdThe restaurant was pretty busy for brunch on Saturday afternoon. It was full of couples and small groups of friends having food and drinks.

Sadly it was no longer on the menu but I still had a great time. The whole restaurant is has a very warm feel from the dim lights natural wood tables and exposed brick. It feels very much like a contemporary romantic America Restaurant. And thats what it is. I really liked the menu even though because of dietary restrictions to nuts and pork about half the menu was off limits for me. The kitchen would have been happy to make changes but sometimes substitutions change the whole dynamic of a dish. I ended up having the fried oysters to start which were the best I have ever have. Other restaurants fried oysters are sometimes still slimy but these were crunchy and served with smoked salmon over some kind of slaw. For an entree I had the trout which was honestly pretty disappointing. They de-boned it like experts but the flavor was a bit on dimensional. It was salty and between the pan searing and the fried fingerling potatoes it was a bit oily. I wish there was a fresh or vegetable component added to the dish. That would have taken it up a notch for me. All in all it was still a nice dinner and the service and drinks were spectacular.

Corned beef Hash with a runny egg is a dish I have craved on hung over mornings for over a decade. Normally I would eat it, slumped half way over a diner table with a luke warm coffee, grumbling words to a dining partner in equal hungover pain. That said, it's a tradition I love. Brooklyn food spots, and brunch spots in particular, have a unfettered 5-10 year tradition of taking classics staples of the middle class kitchen and dining table and \"upscaling\" it into a act of criminal hatred and disregard for fans of the original. \u00a0When I saw \"Corned Beef Tongue Hash w/ a Poached Egg and Hollandaise\" on the menu, suffice to say I approached with the caution that you approach a hungry bear. Yet still, I was hungry and painfully hungover, if ever there was a time my diner staple, it was now. I placed my order and nursed my bloody as I awaited what I was sure was disappointed and anger for hipster brunch culture. The bowl arrived and I was pleasantly surprised that at the very least it looked great. My instagram would surely induce a jealousy, even if the meal was not worth of it. I placed my fork in and broke my egg. The yoke ran; yellow and nearly gelatinous. A great start. I let the goal soak for a moment and then venture my first bite ...Elation is a short version.

The oysters were also fried nicely and complemented well by the salad and smoked salmon. The spoon bread was an interesting... bread pudding / corn bread mix type thing, slightly sweet and slightly savory. It was really like a much moister corn bread, but quite good. Not the most flavorful thing. The shredded kale salad came with apples and a cream dressing, and was good. The poached eggs were on a some ham and a fried potato pancake, served with mixed greens and home fries.

Food was too die for and pricing is so affordable! I ordered the curried goat with white rice and mixed steam vegetable while my boyfriend had the rasta pasta with chicken and shrimp. The curried goat was cooked on-point; Meat was fresh and seasoned so darn well, temperature was piping hot, rice cooked perfectly. There was nothing that could've been wrong about that meal. My boyfriend said the same about his meal. I did not have any drink, so I can't comment on that. Our server was also very kind and her service was awesome. No issues during our meal.

There's something endearing about a restaurant sandwiched between a Western Union and a tire shop that endeavors to create a charming atmosphere in which to serve great food. This spot could have easily been another take-out only joint but, instead, the owners constructed a massive deck, furnished with heaters, a plastic roof, and a fully stocked bar to serve as a lounge for patrons to relax and unwind while enjoying a meal. Yes, the power went out about four or five times during our meal but it only added to the hard-scrabble allure. I was not turned off by it, instead, it made me root harder for them--I support their ingenuity and ambitiousness.The food was okay. I had the Seafood Rasta Pasta and the taste was fine, nothing special, but the some of the seafood was chewy (overcooked) yet edible, which was a good thing because the portions are huge. I tasted the oxtails and they too were okay, nothing special but definitely edible. Before my entree, I had a cup of fish soup and it was great. A little spicy and a lot fishy--just the way it should be. I also tried the potato pudding (dessert) which had a great taste but a gummy consistency. I've never had potato pudding before so I don't know if it were right or wrong but I'm not ordering it again. The Grape Nut ice cream, however, was delicious.

NOT WORTH IT.Here's some backstory...When I finally arrived after taking the bus to get to red hook, I was super pumped to see all this nice outdoor space upstairs at Brooklyn Crab, especially since it was such a nice day out. Sadly, the oyster fest was being hosted on the ground floor in the back next to a row of portapotties...After being in line for a while, we were greeted by hosts that were super enthusiastic and nice. I was thinking, YAY, start to a great event. They give you wristbands, and a mini plastic mug, which I totally thought was a throwaway souvenir but more on that later...It was already such a mess by the time I got there, about 15 min after the start time. There were so many different lines, the space was overcrowded with tables, and a LOT of confused people.- We thought oysters would be delivered to the tables in batches (you know, so overcrowding/lines wouldn't happen). Nope. You have to go to each station yourself and pick up the oysters.- But wait, no plates! We asked the host at the door, they don't know. We ask a waiter, they don't know. We ask the shuckers at the oyster station, THEY DON'T KNOW EITHER. Wow. We had to convince the stand selling food to please give us some trays...pathetic. They said no plates because this was meant to be a tasting (aka you pick one up and eat it right then and there), what the hell.- Some oyster stands insisted we could only get one of each. Others didn't really care how many you grabbed. The shuckers couldn't keep up, poor guys, they should have had at least 2-3 people at each station, and they should have probably had people shucking behind the scenes too!!!- Most of the oysters that were shucked were not separated from the shell and/or had sand/shell in the oyster itself from poor shucking. Ugh.- Remember that mini plastic mug I mentioned they gave us at the door? Turns out, no mini mug, no beer! They would only pour you a tasting size in that mug...this mug was probably 1/3 of a regular beer. Most of my friends who came in didn't even get a mug for some reason and had to go back and ask for one. Most beer vendors didn't care if you just stood there and got refills or poured it into a bigger cup, but why waste people's time when they could be enjoying their full beers for longer with their friends back at their table?!- Event was for sure OVERSOLD. RIDICULOUS. Most people couldn't even get more than 6 oysters, which would have amounted to 1 of each kind they offered.- I think everyone at this event deserves at least a partial refund.The 1-star is for the awesome beer vendors who just seemed genuinely happy to share the beers from their brewery.

Mojjto, frozen margaritas, pina coladas. All those types that will make you feel like you're on an island. The pina colada was so delicious. Others ordered beer buckets for the table, 5 beers that are brought to the table submerged in an ice filled tin bucket. The food! I had the blue crab roll which was $24. It was small for the price but I didn't expect cheap because we're in NY. Others had the king crab roll, lobster, and a brave soul at our table got the full steamer bowl for $50 or $60 which has a variety of fish. It came with a mallet and bib, just like in Maine. The crab rolls come with a side of wavy potato chips. The fries that we ordered on the side were very good. After drinks we went to the lower level where there is cornhole and another bar.

For my appetizer, I got the pork bun and it was pretty good. I also got the Shoyu ramen which was alright. The noodles were decent and the egg was really good but I wasn't a big fan of the pork slice because it was too fatty. The broth was pretty lackluster. The mango mochi ice cream was a nice treat after the meal.Now on to where things went wrong...The bill came out to a little less than $50 and a little over $54 after tax. Calculating for the standard 15% tip, it comes out to be about $61. I gave my friend a $20 and he paid $40 (no tip) for the both of us on his card while my other friend paid $14 (40+14=54 since you can't pay more than the tax+tip) with his card and then added $6 for tip which means we paid $60 in total. When the lady came to get our receipts, she made a big ruckus about how we didn't even pay 10% tip...Uhh yes we did...No idea how she even became a waitress when she can't even do math. She then gave off a really nasty attitude and was still insistent that we were $3 short. NO. Even though we didn't pay 15% it was definitely at least 13%, which in my opinion is a gift for the (lack of) service that we got. No greeting when we walked in, no water refills, no checking up on us periodically. There's another ramen place a few blocks away where the service was absolutely amazing where I didn't mind paying 20% tip. Please go to them and learn a thing or two about hospitality before coming to me and saying I didn't tip enough. Never coming back.PS. We had no intentions of coming here for lunch. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the water system in the East Village and a lot of restaurants had to close/delay opening due to a lack of water.

It was basically like a shoyu ramen doused in some curry flavoring. Considering the fact that I was originally craving real curry, of course this would disappoint. The noodles are too thick for my liking and the flavor was lacking. My cousin wasn't hungry and wanted to share and lo and behold the waitress tells us about the $12 per head minimum in tiny print. I suppose they need that because the food isn't that great. The only decent dish was the negi rice which was filled with flavors.

I was really in the mood for some Italian food and too lazy to cook or go to my favorite place on a Sunday afternoon, so I ordered spaghetti meatballs and cream cake from Sfilatino.It arrived in 20 minuets- very good. The pasta was a disappointment. The meatballs were rubbery and tasted weird. I thought for a second they were a mix of chicken, beef and pork (even though you would expect just beef, right?), so I actually called to ask and they said it was just beef. They were not good, I didn't eat them. The tomato souse was just basic, not too good not too bad. The spaghetti wasn't cooked right, maybe not enough water because there were chunks that stuck to each other. Overall a very disappointing dish for almost $14 w/o tax.

The fact that the sandwich was still extremely hot by the time I took it from the cashier, brought it outside, took it to my building - then elevator - then office, and the less than crunchy bread that I was used to getting from Sfiltano's only told me one thing - MICROWAVED.Really?

My favorite things to order from here are the General Tso's chicken, pork fried rice, beef teriyaki and curry chicken. The General Tso's chicken is amazing! Better than any General Tso's chicken I've ever had before. The chicken comes out crispy even though it's thoroughly coated in sauce. And their pork fried rice is also the best I've ever had. It's always fresh and is loaded with pork and vegetables, which I love. The beef teriyaki is always tender and delicious and the curry chicken is always spicy and loaded with chicken and vegetables. If you order delivery, they are always on time, and quite frequently arrive earlier than anticipated. The only issue I've ever had with Jim's is that they apparently don't know the different between Coke and Pepsi.

Another one at UWS served it fried, crusted with coconut flakes. Ugh!I called Broadway China Station and spoke to a guy (who only today I learned from Grubhub is) named Jimmy. He was so helpful and explained to me their version of Coconut Shrimp. I ordered it straight from him and it was THE BEST!I have ordered through Grubhub a couple more times since then.Today I ordered my usual Coconut Shrimp again but this time with Beef Chow Mein. What arrived was not what I thought Chow Mein was going to be. I called the restaurant and Jimmy explained to me that that's what Chow Mein is, and that I may be looking for Wonton Noodles which they serve in Chinatown. After our call, I searched online for photos and he was right. I am writing this review because I feel Broadway China Station and Jimmy deserve 5 stars!Again, THE BEST Coconut Shrimps ever. I always order mine without the Broccoli they usually place underneath the shrimp, sometimes with the sauce on the side so I can control how much sauce my shrimps swim in, and since it comes only with White Rice, I make sure to upgrade to Fried Rice for an extra $1.Highly recommended!!!"}, {"date": "4/28/2016", "star": 4.0, "review": "My dad owns an Americanized Chinese restaurant so I'm pretty much an expert on these things.

I have come to this conclusion because of how many of their menus I have floating around the house.It's cheap, has good portions for the price (and offers what I like to call, a \"Hawaii person\" amount of rice; 2 scoops+), quick and easy (as they are part of Seamless & deliver) and I know what to expect when it comes to taste.Keep in Mind, I've never actually been to the actual restaurant, as I have always done delivery.Service: So far so good with delivery. Never had a problem, or waited longer then I expected to. Let's just say, of all the places I've ordered from, they are by far the fastest.Price for two: $16 - $22 (My other half and I usually do either 3 Pts, or 1 Pt & 1 Qt)Taste: Like I said before, I know what to expect. I'm not saying it's the best tasting Chinese food in the area. What I am saying is that it satisfies my craving for Chinese food. I do however, prefer their General Tso's Chicken over a few others places in the area.Because this is our usual default Chinese place, we've manage to try a few dishes:~General Tso's: ($5.75/$9.75) Pt/Qt Comes with rice, one of my favorites, the sauce is a lot thicker then the other places I've tried, which are on the soupier side.~Vegetable Chow Fun: ($4.85/$7.60). I prefer flat to round noodles. ~Sauteed Mixed Vegetables ($4.75/$7.75). Decent.~Eggplant with Garlic Sauce ($4.75/$7.75). The eggplant is a bit to soft; mushy sort of. I prefer mine to keep form rather then to fall apart when I stab it with my fork.~String Bean with Garlic Sauce ($4.75/$7.75). Decent, but I find their string beans a bit soft for my liking.~Eggroll ($1.25 each); my other says they are not worth the price. To much dough not enough filling. This goes for the pizza [cheese] roll as well at $1.35 a piece.Random thing I noticed: They are big on giving out their take out menu, which I do appreciate, as I enjoy being able to physically touch and see the WHOLE menu at one time.

I've ordered from here several times, mostly when I'm too lazy to cook or if I'm too tired after coming back from work or if I want to indulge in unhealthy fast food.Located right next to the Broadway stop on the NQ, it's the easiest place for me to go when I come back from work. I just head down the stairs and boom, there it is. There are many Chinese food locations throughout the area and to be honest, price and quality wise, they are all about the same. But I'll review this place as its own.The speed at which they deliver is pretty amazing. They usually get my food to me within 30 min, 45 min tops. I'm used to really slow delivery times, so if this is actually the norm in NYC, you'll have to forgive me. The hostess there is pretty familiar with me, though she asks if I'm Chinese or Korean every so often even though I've told her at least 3 times that I'm Korean. Whatever, she's trying to be friendly, so I'll give her that. The actual store is pretty small and feels somewhat grimy, but I never eat in there (and neither does anyone else for that matter except the employees and their children) so it's more of a take-out waiting lobby.As for the food, I have tried the chow fun, lo mein, orange chicken, orange beef, roast pork, and crab rangoons. Whenever I get anything here, I always have a small side of boneless BBQ spare ribs to go with it. The noodles are all pretty good sizes and I especially like the chow fun. Greasy, but that's okay, I like it messy and sloppy. Their normal food, as for the ones I've tried, are very typical in their tastes - heavy soy sauce, bland fried rice, and abundance of steamed veggies. It's not a bad restaurant and I'll keep ordering from here because of the proximity and the familiarity, but by no means trek from a far distance to \"try\" their food.Also, their policy on free soda is confusing. Sometimes they offer me a free soda of purchases over $10, but sometimes they don't (like today for lunch).

The only thing is, they never read the instructions I wrote for them when I order on the app. For example, I'm allergic to wasabi and I would always include in the instructions very simply written like so: \"please separate wasabi from sushi.\" The wasabi was always closely placed next to one of the rolls and once, it smeared onto two pieces of sushi so I ended up having to sacrifice those pieces.

Like godzilla huge. There was an assortment of fried vegetable tempura, 2 shrimp tempura, 2 large chicken cutlets over some basic tossed salad, a generous portion of rice, a california roll, and \u00a0a bowl of miso to top it off. For a glutton like me you would think that this was a great thing...it was not.To start, all the veggie tempura was super greasy, like it was triple deep fried. My gf and I took a bite of each one and stopped after that. Eating the shrimp tempura was something similar... It looked like 1 whole shrimp had been sliced 3-4 ways, and was battered/fried a million times. The outer crunchy layer was so thick and hard I could have used this thing as a weapon. I made the call to do an emergency extraction of the shrimp because I damn sure was not going to eat 2-3 days worth of oil in one sitting.Saving grace of the meal was the chicken katsu and the white rice. What can I say, it was alot of chicken, not too dry, crispy, goes well with some hot sauce and white rice. California roll was good too, good amount of avocado and fake crab.My gf ordered an unagi/avocado roll, salmon/avocado roll, and some weird special roll. I feel like some of the stuff isn't fresh since the meat (fish) was kind of turning to mush once you bite into it. I'm no sushi expert but I know that good fresh sushi is firm and cool to the touch, not warm and falling apart. Perhaps eating at some of the better spots in the city has spoiled me but I'm just calling it how it is. But hey, everything was less than $30 so my wallet AND our bellies were full hehehe.

It would be easy to dismiss a Washington Heights pizzeria called Papi's Pizza as just another run of the mill neighborhood joint. But if you did that you'd be missing out. I don't find myself in the city very much anymore, let alone Washington Heights, especially now that I've become a family suburbanite woman. As my luck would have it, my brother does find himself in the area on occasion enough to have fallen in love with Papi's, and decided to surprise me and my grandparents with two extra large pies. Throw away your preconceptions about what constitutes \"large\", as I guarantee it doesn't lie in the same vicinity as what we were met with when we opened the box. The pie was the largest thing I had ever seen. Like, EVER. One pie was half plain, half mushroom, the other half sausage & pepper and pepperoni. I should mention as an aside that I'm Italian, so I take things like sausage and peppers very seriously ... none ever compare to the kind my own family makes. We all dove in. The table was quiet, my family contentedly noshing away like it was the last supper. My grandfather only once actually indicated his enjoyment, a Miranda Priestley-like gesture of placing his knuckle to his cheek and sucking in. My grandmother couldn't stop raving about the pepperoni and sausage ... and I had to agree both were delicious. Turns out that's because Papi's gets its meat specially sourced from a butcher that they have a long-standing history with and they season the meat in-house. Their cheese is a specialty kind that is only sold by certain vendors (yes, the dork in me was actually driven to research all of this because I was so impressed by the quality of ingredients). When all was said and done, both pies ended up feeding 10 people ... for lunch and dinner. Despite it's humble and unassuming appearance, Papi's apparently prides itself on maintaining old-fashioned ideals of what a good pizzeria should provide for it's customers: the best and freshest ingredients, tremendous portions and affordable prices (if you were wondering, as I was, what a pie that monstrous would run you, you'll be pleasantly surprised to learn that the 20-inch pizza we had was $16; an 18-inch large pie costs $12). So in its mission, Papi's has succeeded with flying colors. I might actually need to find an excuse to go to Washington Heights now just so I can eat there ... or else bribe my brother to start picking up for us regularly."}, {"date": "10/31/2014", "star": 1.0, "review": "Cheap pizza I guess, it's flatter than copy paper for crying out loud !

The jerk salmon was a big and juicy with a coat of crispy and moistened jerk seasoning that was baked, flawlessly. A side of sauteed, flavorful kale and baby bok choy accompanied the salmon.

So I'm elated that they now have a brick and mortar spot!I've tried everything on their menu.-Jerk Pork- is tender, juicy and flavorful it will leave you wanting more-Jerk Chick- also tender and flavorful and you get a big portion-Jerk Salmon- I order this when I'm trying to eat healthy and I get the same great jerk flavor with a lighter meal.-Ital Stew- this was my second time eating ital stew and I was blown away. It was warm,flavorful and filling. This is going to be a recurring meal for me in the winter season. It's the perfect comfort yet healthy meal.-Jerk wings- these jerk wings are so tender they fall off the bone! I am a huge fan of wings and these are the best jerk wings I've ever had. They were serving them as a special but now they've been added to the menu as an appetizer and I can't be more happy that I can order them any day of the week.I usually wash my meals down with the Ginger-Sorrell drink. It's very refreshing.The atmosphere is laid back, the hostess/waitress was very nice and attentive and the owner Khem is very warm. Years ago I asked Khem for some jerk sauce and bbq sauce when he was working on Lewis & Macdonough and he explained to me that good jerk doesn't need sauce. Let me tell you he was right about that!

I've stepped into the one in Koreatown and left on a couple different occasions just because of how packed it was. The one in Bayside is no different in terms of customers in the restaurant and waiters running around. I arrived at BCD Tofu House on Memorial Day around 7pm and it was a packed house but I only had to wait 5 minutes to get seated for a table of two.When we were seated, it took a good amount of time for a waiter to come and take our order. We ordered 1 Pork Tofu Soup (comes with a bowl of rice), 1 Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap, 1 Tu-Po-Ki. The thing I love about Korean restaurants is the amount of side dishes that come with every single meal. We got side dishes that included: cold mashed potato, sliced pickles, seaweed with radish/daikon, Kimchi, some kind of squid/octopus marinated in sauce, and broccoli. A couple minutes later, they gave us each a small fried fish as another side dish. The waiter noticed that we finished our broccoli and mashed potatoes side dishes early and she gave us a refill (free refills) without us even asking. I've heard a few people say that they could judge a Korean restaurant just by the taste of the Kimchi that they serve. I didn't really like the taste of the Kimchi they gave here, it had a different taste from what I am used to at other places but everyone has different preferences! When the food finally came out after 30 minutes of waiting, there wasn't a smile on my face. The tofu soup tasted bland and only had a little hint of flavor; it seemed diluted and there were barely any pieces of pork in the soup. I had to finish it because it wasn't bad or terrible but I was hungry and also didn't want to waste my money. The Tu-Po-Ki (rice cakes with two dumplings and a boiled egg) was not bad and had a good kick to it with its spicy flavor. The Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap was good and tasty and there were no complaints for that.I wouldn't say that I was all that impressed with BCD Tofu House. The wait was long (ordering, waiting for food, paying for the food), the tofu soup was kind of bland and it was somewhat pricey ($50 after tip) for the quality of food and service which leads me to giving this a 3/5 star review."}, {"date": "5/28/2018", "star": 5.0, "review": "I came here with a few of my coworkers and I got the beef tofu.

They also provide you with a raw egg so that as soon as your soup arrives you can crack it right in there and the high temperature of the soup practically cooks the egg. Seriously, this soup is heavenly! The last time I was here it was snowing and I was battling the flu and this soup was the perfect comfort food along with their green tea. I have also tried the raw marinated crab and it was just a very strange dish for me. The marinade on the crab was delicious but the raw part was not one bit appetizing. I actually ended up taking the raw crab home and making a seafood paella. I like coming here mostly because the food is great and they have a decent sized parking lot. The price is a little steep but they practically load you up with appetizers so I don't really mind. The staff has always been very pleasant on each of my visits which is another reason I continue to come back."}, {"date": "12/21/2017", "star": 4.0, "review": "We were a party of 5 and were quickly seated by the hostess on a Wednesday night.

One variation I totally enjoy is korean tofu which BCD tofu specializes in. This spicy broth is filled with large chunks of silky tofu and accompanied either with your choice of beef, kimchi, seafood or pork. I personally like the mixed one which has both beef and seafood in it. You can pick your level of spiciness but mild is fine for me. The beef is thinly sliced and there were mussels, clams and even a whole shrimp in it. They also give you an egg that you can crack into it since they serve it to you piping hot in a stone bowl and the egg slowly poaches in your hot stew. They give you a bowl of rice with your soup as if it wasn't hearty enough and a refill towards the end of the meal with a bowl of rice taken from the bottom of the pot mixed with barley tea to soften it up.And one cannot forget about the banchan served with the meal. A selection of small cold pickled appetizers like a whole fish for each person, flaming red homemade kimchi, pickles, jalapenos with dried salted fish, shrimp with cabbage and broccoli.We also tried the seafood pancake which comes in two sizes regular of 6 pieces or large with 9pieces. The regular pancake was a good size and came with a tasty soy sesame dipping sauce.They have a great lunch special deal in the afternoons and they even have lunch combos that come with a side of bbq meat as well as a korean tofu soup.Although BCD is a chain they are a very good choice for a family meal. The service and hospitality is great with each person being helpful and courteous. There is a small playroom for kids to mess around in if the wait is long to occupy themselves. And this location also has a small parking lot for the restaurant which is very convenient.

It was a huge place, but there was also a huge line in front of me... I almost did not believe it would be a 15 minute wait. But lo and behold, about 15 minutes later, we were seated. This is a very popular place and I have to say the staff was very good for handling so many tables. Although I still needed to flag down our waiter a few times (especially at the end of our dinner) but overall, the service was very friendly. Our waiter was very quick to give us banchan refills when he saw that we finished some dishes. We ordered the ddukbokki appetizer (quite pricey for $9.95 as it was a smaller dish) and the small seafood pancake (which was quite big for $10 to my surprise). We then ordered a tofu dish for each of us. The tofu dishes were a bit skimpy on the seafood and meat, but not really such a big deal since it was a great amount of food, which we finished. We left feeling very full. Overall, a great, casual place to grab some Korean food at a decent price. Would return to this location since it was spacious and friendly - but it is quite far from us. $106 dollars total tip and tax for a family of 4 with 2 apps and 4 soondubu.

The moment you bite into that fish, its crunchy layer is perfectly followed afterwards with the tender fish meat which just melts in your mouth like butter. Then we got the marinated crabs. The crab meat was tender and very well marinated. I can first taste the sweetness followed by the spiciness of the marination accompanied by the after taste of sweet crab meat. My friend and I shared two dinner combos and were fully fed. My friend ordered the LA Galbi (korean bbq) combo with seafood/beef (mixed) soondooboo while I ordered the jaeyook tofu kimchi with mixed soondooboo. Both combos are very delicious and filling.

They scoop your rice from hot stone bowls right at the table, and then pour hot water over the crispy rice left on the stone to create a mild rice drink to settle up your meal. Their side dishes are always first rate, including the fried fish they bring to start your meal. As my boyfriend joked while we picked out the meat, it certainly keeps you entertained, getting the flesh from the tiny bones with your chopsticks! You can customize your heat levels, so don't worry about spice if you can't handle it. There's also non-soondubu dishes like bulgogi, stuffed tofu, or japchae if you prefer. The stuffed tofu is drizzled with the best sweet yellow sauce - definitely my top recommendation!

When I shared my experience with the manager, he told me it was not possible to help me without seeing the pebble, which I had swallowed.On a second occasion, 4/16/2018 I ate one of their breakfast egg sandwiches (the only thing I've eaten today) and now am on my way to urgent care with a stomach and head ache. The manager showed me a message to him from higher management to throw out eggs that he said was done yesterday, but I remain unconvinced. When I tried to tell him more details about what I ate, he told me to go the hospital and showed me the door. I'm not accusing this cafe of poisoning me, because I neither kept my receipt nor have the money do anything about it.

He has told me twice now that I'm outright lying since his delivery people are telling him that security at my work establishment refuses to announce that they have arrived. (Yet he hasn't spoken with them while I've been on the phone with him.) \"It's your word against my employees',\" he stated. When I ask for the delivery person's name, he refused. When I ask to speak with the delivery person, he refused. When I asked if he could speak with the delivery person as he's on the phone with me to clear this up, he refused. He didn't offer any other suggestions.When I told him that I'd be cancelling my order for today since he wouldn't clear up the issue and was being unprofessional, he said, \"Okay, go ahead.\" And then hung up on me.This isn't brain surgery. It's reading a delivery slip with a phone extension on it."}, {"date": "5/26/2017", "star": 1.0, "review": "I love their salad and how friendly the salad and grill guys are but every time I get a salad, I chew on a mini stone..."}, {"date": "5/13/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "Nice variety here.

It really does make it a more inviting atmosphere for customers. At times, I eat in the back which is always clean and tidy too.

The booths are great because they seat 8-10; however, it is inconvenient if someone has to get up or when food is being passed out.4 people ordered the steak and 3 came together and the other one didn't come for another 20+ minutes.Overall, food is decent with some fun items, but the actually eating experience leaves a little something to be desired.

The cocktails were OK, but the food took forever, strange given how empty the place was. I ordered \"Kung Pao chicken and waffles\" and my friend ordered \"Bananas Foster Baby Cakes\" (note the plural). I had envisioned a stir-fry type Kung Poa chicken served over yummy warm crispy on the outside waffles. But no. The \"Kung Pao chicken and waffles\" was actually chicken wings with Kung Pao sauce with a side of cold waffles and a wad of unmelted butter. The \"Bananas Foster Baby Cakes\" was actually one large rubbery eggy crepe thing covering in a tepid sticky soup of melted whipped cream and coconut sugar goo with soggy walnuts. I'd post a picture, but no one wants to see that. For both items, the menu description was misleading and left much to be desired.We did get a free dessert because our server, who again was excellent, did that to apologize for the kitchen being behind.

It's a great cute time, very New York feel for the location, the decor is beautiful, service is very nice and relative timely.

In terms of an entree, the pork katsu is fantastic, as is the beef kare kare. The short rib had a strange taste when we ordered it, but I blame that more on my lack of Asian Fusion experience. Last time we went we tried the oyster bacon pad thai and, despite generally hating pad thai, I ended up shoveling most of it into my mouth to the point of near-choking, it was THAT good. It's a bit on the pricey side, but these plates are perfect for sharing - two apps, a noodle and an entree is enough to split between two people. Haven't had much in the ways of their cocktails, but they have a downstairs speakeasy behind the bar, Miss Wongs, which is a great time on a summer weekend night.

About 8 of us came here for brunch and were seated at one of the large booths against the wall. I was surprised that it was not more crowded, thinking that our service would be pretty good and we would have our food right away. I couldn't have been more wrong. Our server, although nice, seemed extremely flustered and often could not be found for extended periods of time. He came and took our drink order, brought us a pitcher, then proceeded to ask if we needed more drinks. By this point, we were ready to order and were told that all the food may not come out all at once. After some time, two orders of the breakfast ramen arrived, but without any accompanying silverware. About 15-20 more minutes passed until the next dishes were brought out - three brunch burgers. We asked which burger was which since two were ordered medium rare and one medium well. Another server told us to hang on while she checked. Another few minutes passed until she came back and specified which was which. At this point, the burger was moderately warm and overcooked. The accompanying fries were completely cold. It took several more minutes for my girlfriend's Chinese steamed egg bao to arrive. Once it finally came out, it was ice cold. We nicely advised our server who had it taken care of. Again many more minutes passed until it finally came back. My girlfriend took a few bites and stated she didn't even want it, which after looking at it, I can't blame her. It was very poorly presented, looking like it was quickly thrown together in the kitchen. At the end of the meal, we were asked how everything was and responded with a short 'good.' Even though everyone felt the need to complain, we also didn't have the energy since this experience ended up being such a long, unenjoyable process. I also would've expected our server to even offer to take a pitcher of drinks off the bill or at the very least the bao but no such luck.

The smokiness of the bacon was definitely present and changed the flavor profile of an otherwise familiar pad thai. The texture was also different and had a lot more crunchy elements than usual, including onions, which I tried to eat around.

The pickled ginger cabbage slaw, true to name, is very heavy-handed on the ginger. The nori-seasoned rice was interesting and tasty. But the heart of the dish is the katsu and it was very dry and the breading was hard and crunchy rather than light and airy.The waitress told us that their entree portions are on the larger side and each entree can feed two people.

The drinks here were also great! I got the Magellan's Curse; definitely a hit! You also can't beat the $5 wine/beer special with the HWR. Service, on the other hand, was a little rough. I'm assuming the kitchen got slammed all at the same time so food took long. When dessert came, the (maybe) manager dropped off an order of Flan Spring Roll to my fianc\u00e9 (though he had two orders with him) and left. So I waited longer to get my Flan Spring Rolls. I felt bad because the couple next to us have been waiting for their second dessert while we were eating our main course, and we both got the dessert at the same time.

The blue crab fried rice had generous amounts of crab but it too lacked the flavor profile I was hoping for. The kare kare dish was great! It's a very complex dish with generous portions of the short rib meat. The drinks are also good.

We've lived in JC for about 2.5 years now and we still haven't been here! We decided to finally visit this well-known establishment. Overall, it was a pretty solid experience - I personally think it's more of a 3.5 stars instead of 3, but alas, Yelp doesn't allow half stars.Anyway, when we walked in, they told us that all of the tables were for reservations, but there's a picnic/communal table available we could sit at. However, by the time we left, there were still empty tables! And you can't reserve a table for two online (they only let you reserve for parties of three or more). We didn't really understand why this was the case as we would have preferred a table vs sitting at a communal table and there were clearly tables available.We ordered the kung pao wings, beef short rib kare kare and the pork katsu dishes to share. The kung pao wings were good, flavor was amazing, but the breading was just a touch too heavy for me. They really fill you up. The beef short rib kare kare was very interesting. I've read a lot of the yelp reviews and it's a polarizing dish - either you love it or you hate it. I think it has a lot of complexity in the flavors, which can be a bit confusing. At first, it's sweet, but then it's salty and then you have that 5th flavor, umami, that starts to come out. It's a lot! I personally really enjoyed it. It's a bit of a roller coaster, but one of the most interesting dishes I've had. The pork katsu was fantastic. Breaded perfectly with a citrus-y, yet gravy-like sauce. Rice was also a seaweed rice. Slightly unexpected, but the flavors work together. It is a tad too salty, but the chipotle mayo on the place counter balances the saltiness.Overall, a mix of pros and cons on the dishes. They all had really great flavor, but certain aspects of the dish fell short. Personally, I really didn't like how we couldn't reserve a table online for 2 people. That is poor customer service to me and I don't think I'll be back until they fix that."}], "name": "Talde", "longitude": -74.044296, "latitude": 40.721248, "phone": "2016300077", "price": "$$"}, {"address": "23-10 Jackson AveLong Island City, NY 11101", "CAMIS": "41655832", "review": [{"date": "5/23/2018", "star": 5.0, "review": "Went day yesterday with my wife for dinner and to have drinks it was the second time we were there but the first time we ate there the food was excellent the chef help me out by you not putting shrimp and rice you made a special order for me that was very nice Nancy the bartender was great she was very nice I recommend this place to anyone who lives in Long Island City the happy hour specials are one of the best in the area and I'll definitely be going back there"}, {"date": "5/18/2018", "star": 1.0, "review": "DONT ORDER FROM HERE..

However an offline shot could result in a lost ball penalty, as the leaves would cover your missed attempt.With the issue of leaves aside, it has been a few years since I played Kissena Golf Course because I mostly wrote it of as a \"beginners course\" playing to a par 64, 4511 total yards from the tips. When the round was going along, playing the back tees I found there were particular holes that I did not recall that posed some significant challenges.Hole number 2 is the number one handicap hole on the course, mainly due to its length of 358 yards which would be a shot par four on most all other championship (par 72) golf courses. But to compare Kissena to the par 72 courses is not a fair comparison, it needs to be judged from an Executive golf course lens.Playing with a beginner, I understood Kissena better as to what it offers someone just coming up in the game. More specifically, people in the same general skill level who are not looking for a challenge that would find them over their heads. I did find some shots that took all of my skill and concentration to pull off. Off the top of my head, the par three 9th hole measuring 190 yards plays uphill about 40 feet, into the breeze and to a small green. Missing short, left and long are all dead man's land. I nailed a 4iron as good as I could hit it and luckily walked away with a par because in actual yardage I had the hole playing closer to 220 yards, probably a bit more. The number 12 hole, par 3 is no picnic either, long and with lots of danger lurking everywhere.

The second time I went there was for Dim Sum expecting it to be way better, but was once again let down. I felt like they had very few dishes. The shu mai was way too big, and the Ham Sui Gok had really chewy thick dough. I usually enjoy it being thinner and with a crunch. The same goes for the Jin Dui. The consistency just wasn't the greatest.

So I'll start by saying that I am new to FreshDirect, so I'll try to keep my review as real as it can be. Every time I walk into my local grocery store, I get everything I need. I usually have a list on me and I know where items are located like the back of my hand. Yet, every time I step out of the store... it's an hour and a half later. HOW!? So I started to look for an online service that could replace my need to go grocery shopping. Being in a big city with so much to do, our time is valuable. Spending an hour and a half at the grocery store probably isn't the best use of time. After some research this past week I found out that FreshDirect would probably give me the produce I need at a reasonable cost (would have opted for amazon pantry or google express but they're still lacking). This week I purchased all the items I would usually buy at my local grocery store and realized the total was relatively similar (this includes fresh vegetables, seafood, meat, dairy, etc). So off that bat that was good.Now, delivery. I've read some of the previous reviews and sounds like delivery has begun to be a nightmare. So I was pretty nervous to see what would happen. I had my first delivery today and I cannot complain. It came with the window I picked and all of the food was fresh (maybe even fresher than my local grocery store to be honest).Unlike other reviews, I didn't have any issues with \"hidden fees\" or anything of the nature. You know what you're getting. You see all the details in your cart. You get your final invoice the day of delivery and your final pay MAY change due to items that need to be weighed. In my case, seemed to be only cents off. The ONLY thing I would note is that not all brands are on FreshDirect, so if you happen to have brand loyalty then the options might throw you. Otherwise, everything you need is here for a reasonable price/alternative to picking it up yourself.I'll give FreshDirect a go and if my experience changes, I'll definitely update for you all!"}, {"date": "1/3/2018", "star": 1.0, "review": "Lets start by saying that I was a huge fan of Fresh Direct up until recently.

I was scheduled for 5-6AM unattended front door delivery. I woke up at about 9:00 to find that my order had not been delivered. I checked the status online and it showed \"in route\". I waited for about and hour and, at about 10AM, I called the \"chefs table\" customer service line and told them my delivery had not arrived. The rep said to me that the order was delivered around 5:30. I told the rep that the online status shows \"in route\" to which she replied that the status isn't updated until the end of the shift and is not accurate. What's the point of even having that feature if its not accurate???I reiterated that it was now 10AM, I still don't have my groceries and have to be somewhere at 12. I also have a camera at my door that records everyone who rings the bell and there was nobody recorded from 5am until I opened the door to check for the groceries. The rep contacted the delivery department and I was told that the order may have been delivered to the wrong address and that the driver would come back and sort it out. So now, my food has been sitting outside in \u00a020 degree weather for almost \u00a06 hours and I still don't know when it's going to be delivered. I was told the driver would be here at 11 and it's now after 11. I called back customer service and got a completely different story and that my groceries would be here by 11:30... well guess what? it's 11:40 and still no sign.

I called customer service and they told me the driver was running behind and that I would receive my order by 6 p.m. (My original order was scheduled to be delivered by noon). I had plans that evening and couldn't wait around at my apartment for 6 more hours, so I cancelled the order.

I can see this place runs mostly on take out and delivery but still there's seating, so it should be welcoming. The woman was nice when we asked if we could crank up the heating ( there was an icy draft sitting by the window)- she suggested to sit in the booth near the counter. We kept our heavy jackets on, so we weren't all that comfortable. Next, it took her over 15 minutes to give us our coffee while taking orders of people who came to pick up and take out their coffee and breakfast. She kept saying that she was making a fresh pot just for us. The coffee was ok. It was served in large paper cups like you would drink from picking up. So ok, whatever. She took our orders of French toast, egg and cheese on roll, curly fries, omelettes, and lots of turkey bacon. The food was brought about 20 minutes after we ordered. . . On paper plates. And plastic spoons and forks. . . I guess this place never gets any sit in diners. That probably would not have been a sore point if near the end of our meal another group come in and take a booth... when our server woman takes out silver utensils for them! Were we not worthy of getting those silver spoons forks and knives?! It really put us in a bad mood. Especially because we kept excusing this joint again and again. Last thing I'll write about is the food. It wasn't spectacular. The syrup was literally aunt jemimas bottle (like you brought it from your house). And the ketchup too. At least put them into nice looking containers. I mean we are not snobby but the labels of the items wEre brown and just looked like many hands have touched them.

And watever your opinion was we were in your establishment and will follow rules so if the mustache might be deemed as racist (granted it's stupid af) we will take it off but you don't have to be so nasty about the situation when we have done nothing to you. She already had a vendetta against us so the way she communicated was terrible. Mind you all the workers were wearing sombreros.

Our server did great at explaining all of the traditional yet soho chic dishes. We had the hamachi ceviche-amazing, pulpo and tinga pollo tostadas- yum. And then we had the skirt steak taco special and that was truly to die for. I think I could eat it everyday. For dessert we had the Mexican chocolate lava cake- also amazing.

The place was PACKED and a little loud but lively vibe, pretty dim and the food smelled amazing. We had the pepino diablo and the sexico - delicious! We were seated shortly after and ordered the elote (good but not the best I've had) and an order of chicken tacos and barbacoa tacos.

But unfortunately, we will not spend our money here. This will be all thanks to the service employed here. First and foremost I was hung up on not once, but twice.

Immature and power hungry assuming she has the power to approve or disapprove a reservation. I was also told by the original hostess that acquiring the private room would be \"No big deal\" and when I mentioned that today, I was told otherwise.

DJ plays a good selection of hits. So for dancing and good tunes, this place works. Space/Environment/Decor: From the outside, La Esquina looks like a meat market. You have to walk down SOME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND STEEP stairs. How in the world am I supposed to accomplish this feat after 2 martinis and in 4 inch heels? So annoying.

Elotes Callejeros - fantastic corn with butter and spices. Bistec con queso (steak w/cheese) taco was great - reminded me of the tacos I used to get on holiday in Mexico (away from the tourist traps). 1/2 freebird was moist but nothing special, pork shank was juicy and rich, hamachi ceviche was ok, but tasted much like the red snapper one, and the tuna tartare... all very similar.

The bread isn't so overwhelming and they give a decent amount of meat and veggies inside. Loved it.PhoI ordered the combo for myself and it was delicious. The broth really hit the spot. They gave me so much meat and a lot of noodles as well. Was so full after eating the pho.Crab stewCan't say too much about the crab stew because my boyfriend ate all of it haha but it looked pretty good!

I came in today hoping to order a bbq pork banh mi which is usually one the most popular type of Viet sandwiches but lo and behold, the woman behind the front desk said they are completely out because \"it's the summer and too hot to make bbq pork.\" I already waited 5 minutes to order so I didn't want to leave empty handed so I ordered the #1 classic sandwich which is what they have in stock. After ordering, I waited another 10 minutes for them to make it. During that time, I witnessed the same woman tell a customer she can't eat at the table because she ordered it as take out and she would be fired if caught doing that. A customer behind me who ordered three drinks was told because they are SO busy and its lunch time, the drinks will take 15 minutes to make and asked if she would be able to wait in a condescending tone. I guess they can care less for all the business. It's a shame because the banh mi really did taste good and the food other customers were eating did look authentic.

Overall, the experience was ok.The venue itself is small and actually reminds me of old eateries in Southeast Asia (sans glass store front). There is a counter where you can get some sweets and things to go, and there is a small eat-in area. The bathroom and condiments on the tables were... also like an old eatery in Southeast Asia (and needs some extra TLC). The counter service was good, but the eat-in service was a little sparse. The staff tended to stay on the counter side so it was hard to get their attention.We had to order the standards: the bahn mi (with extra meat, since many reviews commented on their skimp); pho with all of the trimmings, and spring rolls. The items were good, but not outstanding as the ratings would suggest. The pho's broth was straight forward and light. It actually tasted more like a beef broth instead of a complex pho broth (with cinnamon, star anise, etc). I wish it were a little hotter since some the fresh eye round was still pink at the end of the meal. The bahn mi was good but needed the extra meat. We like ours on the spicier end and needed to ask for sides of jalape\u00f1o. The spring rolls were ok.

So, when you arrive there are 10-15 muscled-out guys looking for \"customers.\" Do not get me wrong some of the guys are nice eye candy. However, the annoying part is that some of the dancers are WAAAAAYYYY to aggressive in getting you to purchase a lap dance. FYI: it is 20 bucks per song (that's word on the street). Ok, if I tell you that I did not come here for a lap dance then do not ask me again 15, 30, or 45 minutes later. Maybe you have to pay the dancers 5-10 bucks for them to leave you alone. The good:So why do I go here? I'm my defense, I have been here only two times. But, I will say that the music here is AWESOME. The house DJ plays a nice mix of music from the 90s, early 00s and today. Even though the dance floor is kind of small and crawling with dudes trying to make you purchase a lap dance, you will find yourself grooving and singing along to a song or two. Plus and depending on the DJ, he will take requests. So, you can get your singalong on to TLC's \"Waterfalls\". Also, there is a great mix of people here both in age, race, and body type. \u00a0I find that many of these HK bars have a specific type of client and everyone is a carbon copy of that type. But, Fairytale does not follow that formula. There is even a variety in the lap dancers . . . if you are in to that kind of stuff ;). \u00a0I think there needs to be more diversity for many HK bars but that is a discussion for another type of media.

It was stupid of me to expect good Thai food in a Japanese sushi place. Anyway so we wanted to give them a try and it looked very cute inside. We asked them if they had salmon panang curry but they said they could do a salmon red curry instead, so we agreed.It was the worst tasting red curry I've ever had in my entire life and I felt horrible feeding it to my son. I've made better at home from an amateur online recipe. First of all, the curry tasted so bitter and weird, as if they used the coconut hair oil that Indian women use on their hair instead of actual coconut milk. The worst part was the lack of salmon. They charged me $18 for salmon red curry but I don't think they had actual entree size portions of salmon so they used the tiny sashimi sized salmon pieces. I counted two tiny pieces of salmon in the entire curry and the rest of the curry was filled with tofu pieces that they put in to pretend to be salmon.I was infuriated and told the waiter but all he said was I'm sorry and wouldn't even look at me in the eyes.

I open the bag and the lid of the soup was practically melting into the soup. Yummy addition of plastic for seasoning. I get around to tasting the soup after I use a fire extinguisher to cool it down...and it tasted like fermented cabbage with spoiled vegetables masked with the hot sauce packets from fast food Chinese restaurants topped with a hint of plastic. Then I remembered there should be shrimp in here. I get my fishing pole out and finally find 2 shriveled up baby shrimp at the depths of the swampy vegetables. They were terrible.The sushi was stale, fishy, soggy, and tasted like it was going to expire in 30 mins. I called them up and asked if I can come by and get my money back because the food was ultimately inedible and unenjoyable. After using a Chinese interpreter to get the owner on the phone. He starts barking at me like a rabid dog. He literally said \"you ate the shrimp, I cannot give you your money back, give me my shrimp back\". At this point I was really confused I thought he inhaled too many plastic fumes and suffered mercury poisoning back at the restaurant. I asked him if was planning on reusing the shrimp in another customers dish. He says \"the shrimp cost a money I have to pay for my business.\" Implying that he would actually reuse the cooked shrimp. I was baffled...I will never return to this sorry excuse business and the other 1-2 starred reviews are the most accurate description of this place. The 5 star reviews are questionable and are most likely paid for or have no idea of what real sushi or even decent sushi should be.

Eat at your own risk.UPDATE: Response to David C: No one is trying to \"scam you\" for $5. It was the principle, false advertising, and deceit that infuriated me. Your customers are the ones being scammed. I don't care if it was $1 it was very low quality and inedible food. The owner should have his food license revoked for his unsanitary and unprofessional practices. The false allegations are coming from you. You can pull up your video and you'll see the soup was brought back full and the owner dumped the soup without my permission looking desperatly for the shrimp. He then aggressively forced me to give his 2 baby shrimp back and created a whole scene because he was \"losing money\" lol.

Tables and utensils were clean and neatly arranged and service was excellent and very courteous.Super deluxe bento box special- $20 for your choice of 2 small entrees, 6 pieces of California roll, and miso soup or salad, which I thought was a pretty reasonable deal. I opted for the chicken teriyaki and beef pad thai for my two entrees. The chicken was very delicious and not too dry/rough but the teriyaki sauce was a little lacking in flavor. The pad thai didn't taste authentic but it was still edible.Stampede roll- We got this special roll to share and we all loved it! It's a very complex roll with many layers! On the bottom is a salmon avocado roll and on top is spicy tuna with seaweed salad and salmon eggs. All of these ingredients blended together harmoniously to form a mouth-watering roll that had hints of sweet, spicy, and savory!All sushi places are pretty much the same. What makes Takara a little bit better than the rest:1) Excellent service and fancy/spacious decor2) Stampede special roll was unique and delicious3) $20 Super deluxe bento box special is a pretty good deal, although the entrees were, at most, average tasting.This is my first time in this neighborhood so I don't know what other restaurants there are around here but Takara is definitely a solid option for sushi/Asian cuisine in Whitestone!"}, {"date": "4/30/2016", "star": 4.0, "review": "The sashimi and rolls are really fresh and the portions are big enough to get you full.

Potentially, my entire outlook of NYC might've been different had I not come here.. this place was BY FAR the best value meal I've had during my entire visit!

I had the chicken parmesan and he had the clam linguine, and let me tell you, we were not one bit disappointed!As my pictures can attest, the food looked glorious as it came to our table. From my massive sizzling hot cheesy chicken parm to his overflowing tower of linguine generously topped with clams, we were drooling from the second our eyes made contact with our dishes. Everything was spot on - texture, flavour, temperature, portion, pricing, restaurant environment.. (and probably anything else I haven't listed!).

Quite a few late night egg creams here, and I still have vivid memories of sitting down to a plate of pierogies the morning of the 2016 election. Simpler times.Coming home after an evening flight, I was ravenous and kept thinking about matzo ball soup. I trudged up to Veselka and was welcomed into a half-full dining room around 10 pm on a Sunday. Service was prompt and friendly.I had the vegetarian plate for $15. This is a premium for relatively simple food (you can get a comparative bargain at B&H across the street) but you will not leave hungry.The potato pierogies are far superior to their cheese ones, though as someone who grew up on Mrs. T's, I'm still shocked they don't have potato-and-cheese. Get them boiled, not fried, and cover them in the buttered onions. The sour cream and apple sauce also make for delightful companions.Matzo ball soup is dependable, as is the complimentary sliced bread. The stuffed cabbage was unexpectedly wonderful, with a very flavorful mushroom gravy and a nice rice filling. I ended up taking it home for a solid lunch the next day, and it reheated well. This is a new favorite for me.Top this all off with a chocolate egg cream (here and Yonah Schimmel are the best in the neighborhood, skip Gem Spa) and you have yourself a lovely late night meal, served quick. In and out in about twenty, for about $20.Veselka is a neighborhood treasure, and of course with institutions like this there's a risk of unmet expectations. They've adapted to the times with bougie additions like short rib pierogies and seasonal specials, and prices continue to rise. But there's such a feel-good factor here that I'll always happily come.

My sister who lives in Goshen recommended this place to us for sushi rather than Magoya in Chester, which we love, but which she finds too expensive. I told her I don't eat sushi in fusion places. \"Trust Me\" she said. I did, but I never will again!The first thing patrons see when they enter is a sickly looking fish swimming in very turbid water. As we were led to our table in a very dark corner, the sickening smell, of heavy rancid grease permeated the air. The floor was so greasy that we had little traction walking to our table. It appeared that three kids were running the place and our servers were also the cooks.The menus are just paper take-out menus, filthy with the sticky fingerprints of countless diners. We asked for clean menus and the waitress (I use that term loosely) simply took another dirty menu from an adjacent table.The sushi (which must be sushi-grade to be considered healthy and safe to eat), looked, smelled and tasted like raw fish from Shop-Rite.Some people review this place as though it is some quaint, multi-cultural place, transported right out of Chinatown, but let me tell you, from someone who has worked in Manhattan for 30 years, this place is nothing more than a disgusting, filthy place, that would be closed down by the health department had it been in NYC.For those reviewers claiming it's just cultural differences ... cleanliness and proper sanitation is not a cultural difference. Wiping down the tables with the same dirty rag that was just used to clean a spill up off the floor is plain gross, disgusting and wrong! We skeeve this place! Goshen deserves better.

Their Chinese food has been of the better ones I've been to.Japanese, like all the other Japanese restaurants around here, just is an over priced dish that has many hints of Chinese take.I'd have to admit, their fried rice has been one of the best I've ever tried. Every grain of rice is well coated with grease, which is essential to a good fried rice. They don't try to get fancy with other ingredients, too--just rice, eggs, and meat of your choice.Why the one-star rating, then? You may ask.Last time I bought food from them, it had been a take-out. After a while, my mother's face cringed and spat out what was inside of her mouth. Much to our disbelief, it was a cigarette butt! A cigarette butt! When my mother immediately called the place to complain, all that she'd heard was \"What do you want us[Dragon House] to do?\" Not that it would have been sufficient enough, not a single \"sorry\" was heard.Infuriated, we'd vowed never to go back. That was just wrong..One more thing, I don't know where they get their waitresses from, but their English will just blow your mind off. A simple modification to your order will not be understood. When I'd asked to put less sugar, I had to repeat it about 5 times, before the waitress had to bring out someone that understood me.Some say there exists a restaurant that makes you feel like you're \"there\"?Well, this is it.

If I had to write a research paper and needed to think but also look out the window and think pensive thoughts in interludes, this would be that place. Study breaks would include constant coffee/tea refills and french pastries. The reason I didn't rate it higher is due to the crepes. I had a savory crepe (salmon w/ bechamel/swiss/spinach) and it was served in a sweet pancake crepe - not a galette (buckwheat crepe which is usually for savory ingredients). So, to say the least, something felt off. Sweet crepe batter and smoked salmon are not complementary.I realize that the name of the cafe signifies that this is a fusion crepe cafe. So, I have no clue how crepes are made in Senegal... If I ever return I would only order a sweet crepe - since the inside would match the sweetness of the dough on the outside.

Their service is by no means amazing, but I've come to a point where I go just for the food which is decent for the prices. That is until they increased them, as well as change the menu. These changes were not done everywhere, so when I recently ordered their whole wheat chicken sandwich for delivery from their restaurant site-I spoke to the lady working there who said they don't make it anymore and that she can only offer something of similar value after I've already been waiting an hour. While they did call my phone that was off due to being at work, they could've e-mailed. In addition, restriciting me to a set of choices when it was your mistake in the first place is just bad form, especially when the choices were mostly containing either beef or pasta with no protein with no room for substitutions. After finally deciding to go with what she said to be the spaghetti with shrimp and clams, I made sure to call her back and ask if she said spaghetti since their menu describes a different kind of pasta. Sure enough, she clarified she said spaghetti and the other type of pasta shows up. Thanks a lot Piccolo. I appreciate the unseasoned, boiled brussel sprouts as a half-hearted \"I'm sorry\" but messing up the same order twice is a new one.That being said, it's not the first or third time they messed up my order, so I doubt I'll ever come to the UWS location again.

If you ask about an item, you might as well have ordered it and be ready to pay for it. Portions are not large, but pretty standard for a European restaurant. Prices vary, but the fresh pasta is reasonable. The pasta my dining companions ordered looked pretty good and they finished their plates, so I'm guessing those are safe choices. Do NOT bother with dessert here though. I had a slice of ricotta cheesecake, and it tasted a little stale and quite crumbly and dry, as though it was perhaps not made in-house but bought wholesale from an outside vendor.

I had their pumpkin gnocchi and truffle egg sandwich. I think that the egg sandwich itself was good, but they gave me too much truffle sauce and the color and consistency of the sauce made it look a little unappetizing. The pumpkin gnocchi was pretty good, but I think I'd like to try one of their other pastas the next time I go back. The portions (enough so that you're satisfied) and the prices are just right (average $12 for pasta).

My GF Reuben was $17. \u00a0The first several bites were nothing but bread and I noted their gluten-free bread was inedible, it was falling apart and sandy, with a nasty aftertaste. \u00a0Then I found the sharp, tangy sauerkraut and a huge chunk of fat. \u00a0The kraut was good, just a little too hot and a little too sour. \u00a0The meat appeared to be one giant chunk of fat with a tiny bit of meat attached, but the meat fibers weren't peeling apart like I was used to. \u00a0A bit farther into the sandwich I realized that about 40% of it was a solid block of fat, but the other 60% of the sandwich was a big chunk of good meat. \u00a0So I discarded the 40% fat chunk and re-centered the meat. \u00a0It would have been far more edible if the meat had been sliced instead of thrown on like a chunk of leftover roast, so I was glad to have the bread to help me hold the meat. \u00a0It wasn't fall-apart tender like you'd expect, but it had the most wonderful herbal flavor. \u00a0I didn't detect any Russian dressing, but the flavor of the meat, kraut, and the sweet creamy Swiss was amazing on a cold day. \u00a0So I decided I'd be back in a few days since I couldn't forget about it.My next meal, sadly, was bad enough that I will likely never be back. \u00a0I couldn't bear to eat that awful gluten-free bread again, but the latkes have wheat in them and the poutine gravy has wheat in it. \u00a0I was just going to eat fries, but my spouse thought that was weird and insisted I get a real dish. \u00a0So he got the hot dog deluxe, when deluxe is comes with coleslaw, pickle, and fries. \u00a0He also got a matzo ball soup. \u00a0I got the breakfast sandwich on GF bread with avocado.The Hot Dog came smothered in kraut, which my spouse hates. \u00a0I had to scrape it all off for him and remove all traces from the bun. \u00a0Not sure why the garnishes weren't served on the side. \u00a0Mustard and ketchup would have been a nice touch, on the side of course. \u00a0He loves coleslaw, but said theirs was absolutely disgusting and wouldn't eat it. \u00a0The pickle was a single pickle and the order of fries was rather small. \u00a0The hot dog itself was amazingly flavorful, with sizzling, snappy skin. \u00a0But it was a ton of markup around a single hot-dog, as the rest of the $20 went to a bun and some cabbage he didn't eat. \u00a0He loved the matzo ball soup, saying that it had the perfect amount of dill.My breakfast sandwich: at $15 I expected it to be like the one at Friedman's - really good stuff on some bland GF bread that I could ignore, as it's just a vessel for the flavor explosion inside. \u00a0What I got instead really confused me. \u00a0I got three broken, tiny pieces of bacon. \u00a0At most diners those three pieces would have counted as a single piece. \u00a0I took a photo of them against my fork as a laughable comparison. \u00a0The eggs had the cheese cooked inside of them but I couldn't tell where one ended and one began because the cheese was so bland and the eggs were undercooked. I paid $2 for avocado and received less than 1/10th of a very good but ridiculously-thinly-sliced avocado. \u00a0Again, I used my fork for size comparison as the slices were so small they belonged with the bacon. \u00a0It must have been the shortest avocado ever sold. \u00a0As the service was wonderful, we asked for salt. \u00a0My sandwich had no salt whatsoever even though it had bacon and cheese, but after dumping half of the desert on it, I could finally taste where the cheese ended and the eggs began. \u00a0This place is really strange. \u00a0It seems totally hit and miss. \u00a0The seats were comfortable, the lighting was nice, the service was nice. The corned beef in the reuben was good, the hot dog itself was good, the matzo ball soup was good. \u00a0The GF bread is so bad that bringing my own from home actually would have been more delicious, even though home toasting the bread in the morning leads to chewy, dry, smooshed crumblebread that makes me look like a vagrant when I fish it out of my purse. \u00a0The breakfast sandwich was horrifically bad, and it didn't make sense that they threw everything on top of the hot dog without asking. \u00a0I really believe my sandwich was made improperly, and I'm quite sure they accidentally gave us 1/2 an order of fries because nobody would pay $8 for that 'deluxe'. The prices were atrocious, which is understandable when getting kosher-style deli volumes of meat, but not when the amounts you get are weird and cheap. \u00a0I also think my reuben may have been made incorrectly as you usually slice the meat, and you don't put a wad of fat the size of a Twinkie on the sandwich, and Russian dressing is included. \u00a0Not likely to try again unless my past meals were refunded, or my next meal was comped."}, {"date": "3/28/2018", "star": 4.0, "review": "Based on its cute signage, trendy location, and hearty brunch menu, I was sure that there would be a long line mid-day on a Saturday.

A great spot to go to, however, if you haven't eaten all morning and are coming from an extra intense workout class, like I did. There were so many tempting options on the menu that I had a bit of an anxiety attack, but at the end I decided to go with their special, which was a breakfast latke platter with two eggs and style and beef salami. The latkes were fat and flavorful and wonderfully crispy on the outside. I still think it would have been better with apple sauce or sour cream on the side, but this dish didn't provide the classic latke condiments.The eggs, as they were any style, were perfect per my specifications. I was less impressed by the salami as I felt that it was a bit too tough and dry, but a squirt of mustard made it much better. All was washed down with some fresh, very pulpy orange juice and coffee. My husband had the brisket hash which was very tasty as well, though again needed a bit of a condiment enhancement. I'd love to come back for lunch to check out one of their sandwiches, or maybe an indulgent dinner with some of their famous poutine for the table. I also must get a Black Seed bagel on the side next time, as it's much better than waiting in line for one at the store.

I was here a couple of years ago for Pesach, and I adored their communal Seder (along with the smoked lamb shoulder). For one evening, a bunch of strangers became mispocha and celebrated the Exodus while enjoying some of the finest Jewish deli food Montreal has to offer without having to cross the border. Last night's Rosh Hashanah meal at Mile End, however, was a bittersweet start to the New Year. I had seen the menu for their Rosh Hashanah dinner, and it looked outstanding. Classics like matzo ball soup, and upgraded desserts like apple honey pudding cake? Yes, please. So I emailed them about reservations for two last weekend. Within the hour, I received a response telling me they had plenty of flexibility for a party of two either evening. We filled out the credit card authorization form, confirmed a reservation for 9/20 at 7:30, received a confirmation email from Mile End, and thought it was a done deal.When we arrived there last night at 7:30, my bf and I were greeted as if we had landed from Pluto. The hostess looked at the list of names for reservations on the wall, and we weren't there, but she acknowledged our names sounded familiar. We brought up the email confirming our reservation, and her response was, \"Oh f--k. Well, we don't have any tables ready right now, so it's going to be a little bit of a wait. We have a table that's already paid, we're just waiting for them to finish up and leave.\" In the land of appropriate responses to give to paying customers when a provider has messed up, I really don't think \"Oh f--k.\" is acceptable. Perhaps, \"Would you like a glass of water/wine while you wait?\" might have been a nicer alternative. I mean, really. I get that at my local sushi joint when I go there and wait for take-out. We stood there waiting awkwardly for a table while only occasionally being acknowledged, and the most hurtful part was that we knew damned well the owner knew exactly what was going on, and he strolled back and forth in front of us several times, ignoring us, because he was preoccupied with the fact that he was going to dine with his own family and friends at the same time. Was the dinner good? Yes. The dinner was delicious. But the problem was that the way we were \"greeted\" upon our entrance (dis)colored the entire evening. We were barely nodded at when we left. We weren't looking for a comped meal. We weren't looking for a comped anything (despite the fact that we ordered a bottle of wine on top of a $75/pp meal where we were seated next to the kitchen on top of fruit flies), and the meal without tip was over $200. It was the fact that there was no accountability at all. Last night, no one ever acknowledged that s/he messed up our reservation, and the words \"I'm sorry\" never came out of the hostess' mouth. Instead, it was, \"F--k, we don't have any seats right now,\" as if it was our fault. For a place that claims to serve the food of my people, it doesn't seem as if they practice our values.

How could we possibly try anything else at a Jewish Deli? For $15.00 you get a decent (although not huge) sized sandwich split in two. Pastrami on Rye with a small amount of mustard. I'm happy they did not go wild with the mustard as that would have overshadowed the taste of the meat to much. This was absolutely delicious !We ordered a large side of poutine for 3 ($12.00). The poutine was pretty good, although I liked the one I had at some famous spot in Montreal a bit better. Overall, I would return here over Katz any day ! I liked the attitude of the servers and the food quality more.

Want to try some old school Jewish food with a mix of Canadian Flavor? Then look no further then Mile End Deli. I heard that they originally opened in Brooklyn, but stopped by the Manhattan location for lunch on a friday. The menu is pretty expansive with plenty of bagel choices (made Canadian style, which is thinner). \u00a0One of the members of my group mentioned how Mile End is an area of Montreal (shame on me for not knowing after 3 visits there), but they certainly lived up to the Canadian name by serving some awesome Poutine. For those who haven't had late night eats north of the border it is french fries drenched in gravy with cheese curds. While it is a drunken delicacy in canada, it is a great accompaniment to an old school NYC sandwich as well. The choice I made (the only choice for a first timer) is the smoked meat sandwich filled with cured beef brisket with mustard on rye bread.For $15 dollars I wouldnt say the sandwich was overwhelming big like you'd get at Katz, but it was more then enough for a lunch and the brisket was really tasty. We had a group of 4 and 3 of us split a large poutine ($12) and it was just about enough to share, while the other member got the smoked brisket + deluxe w. poutine (included for $10 extra dollars classic poutine, coleslaw, and a pickle). If your super hungry I'd go with the deluxe but your more then likely going to take some home then.The waitress was friendly and even suggested for any take-home brisket to put it on the pan and mix it with some eggs.

I got the small size and I was saddened when it came to the table because there were only a few, tiny pieces of cured and smoked beef brisket in there. I must say that the pieces that I did taste were really flavorful. But, it's tough to judge how good their meat is without a more substantial portion. Perhaps I should've gotten the large poutine or probably the sandwich for a better opportunity to really enjoy the meat.The poutine itself was okay. The food came out so fast so I'm not sure if they were cooking it to order. The dish was cold, the fries were not crispy enough for me and the cheese curds were cut in tiny pieces with a gravy that could've used more seasoning on top. What was good however was the Mont Royal - potato latkes, smoked salmon, sour cream, and caviar.

The poutine (as far as I could tell) was nothing of the sort, as it had no cheese curds. But it was oh-so-tasty. The mini-brats were soaked in beer, and I've rarely tasted a better use of suds. The sharp taste was carried forth even further by the sauerkraut, and then balanced by the tots. The bratwurst was part of the restaurant's \"Poutine Week\". As good as it was, I felt it wasn't representative of this elusive Canadian dish. So I went back a few days later for the \"Meatlover's Poutine\". Here was the real deal: a mountain of fries, hot dogs, gravy, etc, that could easily feed three people. \u00a0Having finished it however, I'm offering the snap judgement that our northern neighbor's version of 'loaded fries' is not up to par with 'Merica's. USA! USA!In passing, I'll mention that the Manischewitz spritzer with lime was a tasty cocktail that played off the restaurant's core compentancy of jewish cuisine.

But in any event, they have online reservations if you're interested. Probably seats about 50 total, and it's spacious enough. They have a take out counter at the front. Food: by the time we were there, they were out of quite a few foods, including the infamous smoked meat dinner plate and sandwich. Luckily we were there for the poutine and they had enough meats left to make a smoked meat poutine. The large is $16 and great for two people to share. The fries are nice and adequately crispy, the gravy is standard and thick, and they are generous with the cheese curds. What makes this poutine special is the tender, perfectly salted, and tasty smoked meat. I felt like they could've put a little more on it for the price, but alas I was grateful to just have some. We also ordered the smoked duck grilled cheese to share, which was tasty, however not the tasty I expected. It was rather small for a whopping $14, but the eggs is perfectly over easy and the bread is nice and buttered and soft yet crispy. However the duck is thinly sliced and overpowered by the sweet flavor of the maple glaze. It pretty much just tasted like breakfast, which is great but not what I wanted in particular.Service: quick and friendlyI definitely want to come back to eat more of the smoked meat and the poutine!

The dish was overwhelmingly salty. Worse, the onions weren't caramelized. They're sauteed, which you can see in some of the photos users have uploaded. Big difference! I didn't think the sauteed onions worked well at all. The bagel is a Black Seed bagel and they're not my favorite, I just don't think they're big or chewy enough. They also slathered an ungodly amount of butter on it, and that's saying something coming from me. Not only did I not ask for butter, but every time I took a bite out of it butter came spilling out of the sides and over my fingers, not a great experience. The matzoh ball soup should be called dill soup, because that's the main flavor present. It reeks of dill, the smell as well as the taste completely overpowers everything else.

I find myself coming here at least once a week, sometimes more when I find myself craving the awesome food here. Not once did I come home regretting the food I come back with, because every-time I've eaten it, the food has always been seriously delicious and leave me satisfied as hell. The food is always cooked fresh, and cooked perfectly. It's also cooked at the right speed so you won't be waiting long. (Though please be patient if there is multiple people waiting, the vendor wants to make sure you and everyone's food is delicious and cooked to perfection!) Never have I had any stomach problems, so do not fear any kind of bowel issues or sickness.Both Lamb and the Chicken are delicious on their own, I have a hard time deciding so I personally always go with Mix Meat for both Chicken and Lamb! Always ask for the white sauce and hot sauce.Both Gyro and Rice Combos come out great. There are many options, including healthier one like salad and meat. There is even Spicy rice as alternative to yellow rice if you prefer something hotter. The Price is very affordable, and every dollar is worth it. 6 dollars for a Rice Combo, but I personally like to add sliced up pita bread on my rice combo, for 7 dollars, comes with a soda can.If your on a budget, just 5 dollars will grant you a very delicious Gyro sandwich with a can of Soda that will fill you up, and the taste will leave you wanting to come back. I can't stop talking about the delicious food because imo, it's easily the most delicious food around the Crosby neighborhood and I've eaten everywhere around here at least once. But outside of the food, the service is excellent to! The Owner/Cook there, Sawi, is very friendly. He will give you a friendly greeting every time you come by even if your not ordering. He's always very friendly with the neighborhood and will take care of you orders however you want every time. The Cart is set up right in front of a 24 hr Rite Aid Pharmacy in Crosby, Near the 6 Train Buhre Avenue train station, the 8 Bus drives by there, many different banks.

I had a hard time looking for this cart. Its located on sacket ave. right across the street from the hospital parking lot. I am currently on vacation overseas. I saw something on facebook about the best food trucks in NYC. I wasnt surprised that the Big Taste Halal cart wasnt there. It is in a fairly remote ish location. Its not on a major road. This cart is a hidden, polished, perfectly cut gem! People who work at the hospital, whoever have been to this hospital and I are the only people lucky enough to have the pleasure of eating from this cart. BEWARE parking is difficult around here. I almost got a ticket. I am on the road a lot for work. From Westchester, the bronx, NYC, brooklyn, queens, Nassau and a little bit of suffolk. I go to different homes, buildings and businesses and when its busy i can sometimes visit up to 14 or more places in a night. I find good places to eat. 1 slow day at work i was doing a search for a good halal cart in the bx and i found this. I was on the west side of the bronx but didnt mind driving at all from what i read here on yelp. It said this place is open from 7am-7pm, try and get there no later than 6, he sells out. It was 7:30 and i drove anyway. Well he was already packed and ready to go home. I tried 3 different times to get food from this guy. Finally the 3rd time i got lucky! I placed an order for combo (lamb and chicken) over rice and he said i dont anymore rice and only have pita left, so i settled. I like to watch my food being made. He take chicken from his food bin chops it and puts it on the grill he did the same after he slices some lamb. While on the grill he put this (sorry for not knowing the name of it) thing people use to flatten out bacon when cooking it. One thing i noticed differently he did that most, if not all, other halal carts do is he puts some white sauce on the pita and grills it sauce side down. After receiving my order i quickly drove off into the sunset lol, before the meter maid come back and give me a ticket. I bite into my much awaited food from this cart and all i can say is WOW! Well worth the effort i put in. If i am in the area i would definitely make this my first choice. A part of me would to see this guy closer and more accessible to where i live and the other part of me let this cart stay where it belongs because if it is closer to me i'll gain so much weight and it wont be so special to me."}, {"date": "5/7/2013", "star": 5.0, "review": "delicious! \u00a0good price! \u00a0great service! \u00a0best kept secret in the neighborhood, I think!"}, {"date": "3/9/2013\n ", "star": 5.0, "review": "Halal Guys from Manhattan...Move over !

I can literally finish 6 sets in that time that i miss out on because apparently everyone needs to be out of the gym 5 minutes early in case they need to go to the locker room(which I never do). I've never had this experience at Glendale - in fact sometimes I stay a couple of minutes extra and it's never an issue. If I'm paying to have a gym open until 12am, I deserve to use the gym every minute of that time. This place has definitely gotten a lot better since the upgrades. It's a lot more open and spacious!

I understand I signed the contact to become a member but now I've come to realize just how punitive and egregious the cancellation policy really is.How is it that I can cancel all my bills AND MY LEASE more easily than get out of this gym membership? We began in January and though we have only been members for 6 months, we had to pay the automatic annual fee- fine whatever. But now we are responsible for months of payments beyond our last day of even using the gym facilities! My fiance and I have had an unexpected relocation for work and have to move in 30 days or less. The cancellation policy keeps you responsible for 60 days for cancellations which in New York City is alone an insane requirement. \u00a0We called their financial firm multiple time to get answers about canceling our membership and they said they would call us back when they had an answer- too bad for us they didn't call back for over a week- which ran us into an additional month (on top of the 2 we were already responsibility for- though we have already moved away). Just don't waste your time. Before I came to Retro I was at a Planet Fitness and will be running back to them. Their membership is significantly more flexible and staff much more accommodating and friendly. My fiance and I will end up paying the same for the 3 months we are not even using the gym than the 6 months we were active members.

This is the worst gym I've ever experienced in my life. Let me start by saying that I used the RF in Astoria for years and loved it. The staff were always INCREDIBLY pleasant, helpful, etc etc. We then moved to the area and soon after, this location was built. From the first time we stepped into this gym, we were met by very rude staff. We told them we were so excited the location was finally finished and asked if we could see it. It took a lot of convincing to make that happen as we were told, through sighs and eye rolls \"well..we don't let nonmembers into the gym.\" (Understand we were still members at Astoria, we just wanted to see the new facility). From that experience on, it has been one issue after another with their staff. I'm sure there's a character limit somewhere on Yelp, so I'll try to just give you a few instances...Once, I lost my debit card and had to have it replaced. I went into the gym a week later and was told \"oh, your membership is due..the payment was denied\" I said \"oh yeah, I had to have my card replaced, I can pay it now\" and was told \"yeah....but it's technically late so there's a late fee...\"Once I needed a place to stretch and there was no place to do it, so I went into a room they had off to the side...quietly, minding my own business, by myself...A staff member busts in the room and YELLS \"you can't be in here!! This is for the trainers!!\" I tried to politely explain why I was there in the first place but was cut off \"No no no...this is ONLY for VIP members with a trainer!\"My husbands debit card had been replaced recently and we were out of town. He knew his membership was due, so he asked his mother who was housesitting for us to walk down to the gym and pay cash for his monthly fee and he would apply the new card when we returned. The next time he went in, he was told there was a late fee because his yearly fee was also due. Add all of these instances, plus more (I've also witnessed them with other guests)..plus the overwhelming sense of pretentiousness/rudeness/incompetence of the staff and this will be the biggest ripoff of a gym you'll ever join. Finally, FINALLY my husband and I found the YMCA in the area and they have GREAT prices! With a friendly staff!! We told RF we would be cancelling and we're practically harassed with \"you can't do that! You signed a contract!

My experience with this gym has been both positive and negative. The positive qualities that this gym has is that their staff is nice and cordial, and the facility for the most part is kept clean and well maintained. Furthermore, their smoothie bar is very delicious. This is all great; however, as a client that is looking for a great workout they need to work on several components that will get you the most out of your workout. \u00a0Some of the things that this particular location needs to improve on are the following:1. Signing up for classes- when you pay extra in your membership you expect to go to your gym classes without any problem. However, because this gym has limited space they cap out at 30 for some classes and 19 for their spin classes. This then becomes a tedious job of running to your phone or laptop to sign up for a certain class in order to be able to participate in them. For example, one day while I was trying to sign up for their spin classes, I literally logged in at 6:31 and the class opened at 6:30 and it was already full. Meanwhile, this is the whole point of \u00a0you paying extra in your membership. 2. Yoga Gym Instructors- \u00a0If you are going to have gym instructors teaching the class please make sure they are certified in that area. My experienced with the yoga instructors are that they need to work on giving a full body workout and not talking about how certain positions are beneficial to your body.3. Afternoon Peak Time(5-9pm)- During this time it's impossible to have a decent workout it's very crowded and there are no machines or weights available to use appropriately. Furthermore, you end up wasting time waiting to use these equipment instead utilizing your time in getting in a good workout. Overall, the retro fitness gym is a gym that looks good on the outside but lacks the important gym qualities that a client is truly looking for in their gym experience."}, {"date": "4/11/2017", "star": 2.0, "review": "Dual review.I joined another branch of Retro Fitness and have been going locally to the Rego Park location. \u00a0I do not enjoy workouts at Rego Park - the gym is always packed after work (7pm), and even if I wait a bit (9pm), it's still packed. \u00a0For example, if I want to use the lat pulldown, I'd have to wait for a group of four guys to finish up, jump in, and have someone else waiting behind me. \u00a0I also don't feel I get proper range of motion with the equipment there and it's a pain to find weights to use, and there's no parking lot. \u00a0My guess is that former 24-hour fitness members moved over to this location after they closed down - destroying the gym experience. \u00a0It's a shame, given that this is a fairly newly gym. \u00a0Would be better if they limit the number of members that are checked in at one time.Last two times, I drove to Glendale, which has a nice big parking lot. \u00a0Very spacious gym...didn't have to wait much at all for anything. \u00a0Weights are readily available. \u00a0They use Hammer Strength, and while the equipment is a bit older than Rego Park's, it felt so much better - a more natural range of motion. \u00a0Staff does a great job in keeping it organized and customers are all friendly / respectful. \u00a0Seems like customers are more serious about physical fitness here than at Rego Park - provides a better workout atmosphere.EDIT: response to business owner's comment below:Hi Diane,I appreciate your response...however, I do not attend classes nor use a personal trainer. \u00a0I just like going to a gym and be in-and-out in an hour. \u00a0Unfortunately, as I mentioned in my review, the gym is usually packed so I can never have achieve a fluid workout there - I have to constantly modify my workout routine to accommodate availability of equipment.I appreciate how it can be busy during peak hours (usually 6-8pm at most gyms I've been to in Queens), however, was surprised that there was no relief at 9-10pm. \u00a0Also, relative to four other gyms I've been to in queens, this gym is much more packed during peak hours to the point that it's uncomfortable being there. \u00a0If I can't get a decent workout at 9 or 10 at night after work, it means I can never workout at your during the work week.I really wanted this to be my preferred gym as it's only 10 minutes away from me. \u00a0Instead, I now must commute 20-30 minutes each way to other Retro Fitness locations. \u00a0Perhaps will give another try in the future to see if anything changes."}, {"date": "3/31/2017", "star": 1.0, "review": "Shady business practices for sure!!

In fact, I think it is specious enough with enough equipment to plan your training accordingly. The class room is available for use if no classes are being scheduled. There is also a room for spin classes, and If I am not mistaken you can use it as well if no class is in session. Front desk staff is very courteous, friendly, and always ready to assist you. Few times I have been asked by the gym guests how do I like it, and I always say the same: It's really serving it's purpose.

For the hours - most retro fitness in this area are open till 10pm or midnight. The space in the locker room is really tight and almost no where to sit during peak hours and the gym itself seems like machines are really squished in when people are walking around and such.I also wish there was another free weight rack.

Since my order was placed before 10am on a Monday and I got an immediate email order confirmation, I assumed the cookies would arrive by Tuesday evening. Upon checking in with my family members on Tuesday, they never received their gift. I immediately called William Greenberg, only to get an answering machine. I left a message, and also wrote an email to them using the contact us button on their website so there was record of my outreach. The next morning (now Wednesday) I got an email from a \"Carol\" using an AOL email address, saying they would refund my shipping if I would please email her back my credit card info and billing information. Not feeling comfortable sending my financial information over email to an unverified person or email address, I immediately replied asking if I could be contacted by a representative instead. No response.Thursday I called the bakery again, and finally got a hold of an employee in the store. I was told a manager would immediately call me back. After a few hours, I never got a return call, so I tried calling the store again only to be told that the manager had left for the day and no one else could help me. The employee I spoke with said I could call back at 9am the next morning to speak with the manager. Meanwhile...still no cookies.Friday I called the bakery at 9am as instructed, only to be met with another voice mailbox. Frustrated, I finally called my bank and disputed the $60+ charge on my credit card. A few hours later, I (magically!) got a call from the bakery from a woman named Maria, who told me they received my complaint and would be happy to refund my order. However, their main location where they keep the billing records was currently closed for a renovation, so would I mind calling HER back on Monday to get my refund? Ummm, no. At that point, I let my bank continue to handle the problem until I got my refund. Having never gotten my order, I have no feedback on if their cookies actually live up to their reputation. However, with the absolute nightmare of customer service I'd be willing to bet there are MANY more bakeries in NYC who can and will provide not only great pastries but great service as well."}, {"date": "9/17/2015", "star": 1.0, "review": "This is only a review for their customer service and internet ordering service - NOT for their product, since we never got to try it! I ordered their famous black/white cookie minis as a gift to be delivered to an address close to their home location in NYC. I received a confirmation by email after placing my order, specifying when/where they were to be delivered via FedEx, including my instructions to leave the package with the doorman.The package was not delivered (which was unfortunate, as they were a birthday gift), so I emailed back, including the confirmation I'd received, asking about what happened to my order. I received NO response at all. I called the shop today and spoke to Angie, who at first could not locate my order (because she neglected to ask for pertinent details before putting me on hold twice to go look!) and eventually told me that my order HAD been delivered. She said that she had a receipt for the delivery. I said that I was planning to call my credit card company to dispute the charges so I'd like to see that receipt. Angie said she would email me a copy of the receipt without delay.Less than an hour later, I received an email from another company (Carol Becker?) stating that I would receive a credit in the amount of the order!

The alligator was meh and i was the only real one eating it, but on the other hand those Truffle fries were DELICIOUSS.The down by the bayou- bbq pulled pork with melted cheddar cheese tacos were cute, the jen men shrimp tacos- saut\u00e9ed cajun spiced shrimp, pico, lettuce & chipotle were much better.

I got the fried seafood platter- shrimps, calamari, cod, oysters with a side of grilled corn, slaw and fries. That was out of control, so much food !!

And we didn't miss.Place is small, cosy with faded lighting. Cool decor, brick walls, newspaper style table covers, a bit tight sitting, but I don't mind that. Super friendly staff. Even though it got more busy after, our guy still had a chance to drop by to ask how's everything and have a quick chat. I almost felt guilty for keeping him. Never had southern food before. Always wanted to try shrimp and grits. And boy was it fantastic. Huge plate portion, lots of big shrimps, they weren't messing around. A tad spicy, but tolerable, and oh so deliscios. I couldn't even finish it, and it made its way home for a goody next day leftover lunch. Yum. Hubby had a quesadilla. Was big, served with side veggies.

I love salad with strawberry and feta and that red wine vinaigrette was delicious on top. \u00a0I only had to take off a few spoonfuls of the feta as I don't like that much feta on the salad but otherwise good overall. Cousin ordered fish tacos and enjoyed them though they were a bit spicy but that was expected. She enjoyed her meal.Friend ordered vaquero salad. It was a bit dry so she asked for an extra side of dressing but otherwise it was fine. We also ordered a dessert to go and it was decadent!! Chocolate brownie peanut butter mousse in a mason jar. Delish!As I mentioned, \u00a0we are celebrating my bachelorette day so I ordered a peach mojito to go with my meal.

They said they don't sell crullers at that time, and I said I was surprised that they were sold out. When I arrived at the restaurant waiting for my takeout order, I noticed that folks eating in the restaurant were able to order crullers. I asked for clarification and was told that they only sell crullers to folks who eat in the restaurant and they do not sell crullers for takeout orders. In the past, when I ordered takeouts at 9 AM, they would sell crullers.The above is my review about a month ago. At the time, a \"George K\" contacted me through Yelp and apologized for their restaurant policy regarding selling crullers only to dined-in customers and had communicated to me that they will rectify the situation. Further, he communicated that for my next order, I will receive a 10% discount for which I expressed my thanks.Today I placed an order and when I arrived I provided my information to the cashier lady and expressed to her that George K had provided me a 10% discount. She claimed she did not know a George K, and a man who was either a manager or an owner declared that the they never give discounts. So, either George K who seemingly has authority to respond on behalf of Nan Bei Ho on Yelp is bogus or if he is not bogus, he has no authority to give discounts.

We were in the area and i was craving Mexican, so we decided to come here. They have happy hour deals M-F til 8pm; 2 tacos for $6, $5 draft beers and $9 cocktails. Unfortunately, i missed the happy hour and had to pay full price for the 2 orders of tacos (comes with 2 tacos each), the queso dip, and guac and chips. The tacos at regular price is $9 for 2, which is quite expensive for the actual size of these tacos. They were quite small and definitely would not be able to get you full without other sides to accompany it. We had the chicken and shrimp tacos which were both good, but not really worth it for the non-HH pricing. I thought it was going to be grilled chicken, but it was more of a slow cooked/pulled chicken, but it wasn't bad by any means. The shrimp tacos were better, but still not enough for me! The queso dip was delicious, but tasted almost exactly like the cheese dip you get with chips at the move theater (which i happen to love, so this worked in its favor). The guac was a generous portion and i enjoyed it. My only complaint about the guac would be that it's just a TAD on the citrus-y side. We also had the Aperol Spritz which was REALLY good. The other drinks people were ordering looked great too. I was eye-ing this chick's Brancolada (almost like a pina colada) - it looked so yummy. Ambiance is pretty cool.

OMG was it delicious. The waitress told me if was #1 in all of New York. Mai Thai's are not on the happy hour menu, but I had to try it since I did move to New York from Florida. I also got the special frozen cocktail. It was a frozen red wine mixed with brandy and cinnamon. It tasted just like Christmas. I would order several of those again.

I was in the city for two nights and he wanted to take us out to a tasty but simple dinner. We all liked the idea of tacos and he said he knew just the spot.Donna was created by Leif Young Huckman & features a rum-driven cocktail list & delicious tacos. The atmosphere is cool and dark, loud music being DJed throughout. There are bar seats and tables but it is a small joint and quite intimate. We came on a Saturday night & the place was crazy busy - I was actually surprised my stepbrother was so cool to know all the happening joints. He's a total hipster but I am grateful he knew of some happening spots. After he talked to a few servers he knew, he managed to get us a sweet spot at the bar where we ordered beers and perused the simple menu. My stepbro wanted to order for us so we let him take reigns. One order of every taco on the menu & nachos. Each order of tacos came with two tacos and we decided we could just all share. There were 5 different types of tacos:1- Chicken with Chipotle, Guacamole, Pico de Gallo, Crema, Sesame & Cilantro2- Slow-Roasted Pork with Salsa Verde, Purple Sauerkraut, Pickled Onion, Cotija, Chicharron & Tajin3- Pan-Seared Basa with Guacamole, Purple Sauerkraut, Pickled Pineapple Salsa, Serrano & Cilantro4- Roasted Root Veg [Beets, Yams, Carrots] with Guacamole, Pico de Gallo & Cilantro5- Marinated Shrimp with Garlic, Parsley, Ginger, White Sauerkraut, Pico de Gallo, Lime Mayo, Sesame & CilantroThe tacos were friggen delicious, cannot lie. I'm usually a crunchy taco person but these were authentic, perfect combinations and full of flavor. Surprisingly, the vegetable taco was one of my faves along with the pork. I don't even love seafood and those fish tacos were pretty bomb.The nachos had yellow queso, black beans, guacamole, pico de gallo, pickled onion, crema, cotija & cilantro. I wasn't totally into the queso, it was kind of like the jarred stuff. I was a little surprised by these after eating the tacos. I don't think I'd order them again purely because the tacos were so delicious.They had a HUGE cocktail menu to choose from, a decent beer selection and great food. Service at the bar wasn't bad and we were checked on a few times although we had to ask for more water. Overall we had an excellent time here.

Their draft Aperol Spritz (aperol, grapefruit, white wine, seltzer) is the quintessential taste of summer. It's always Spritz O'Clock in the summer baby!

We had chips with queso and salsa - a perfect afternoon snack to split - and our delightful server brought out more chips when we still had more dips. Leaning heavier on dips in the dip to chip ratio is always preferred if the restaurant is willing to bring out more chips without ridiculously upcharging.

It was a half pour of whiskey served in a thin rocks, with three cold draft ice cubes and garnished with both a large orange peel and smaller lemon peel. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. They had Chicharron (fried pork skins) on the menu but were no longer available. The bartender offered me an empanada instead ... which they were also not serving. Instead, I decided to take advantage of their M-F 5-7 Happy Hour and get half off Chicken Pibil Tacos ($9 regularly). The double corn tortillas were soft. The shredded chicken was for the most part tender and must be housemade because I found a little piece of tendon. The avocado was more like guacamole spread on the bottom. The toppings of crema, pico, and tomatillo made for a decent bite to eat. The cocktail menu was fun and interesting. It included infographics displaying the style of each of the cocktails.

Also, I wanted my sushi with brown rice but there was no box to check so I left it in the notes, but they called me and said that I'd have to have an extra $2 in cash ready if I wanted the brown rice as it wasn't included in the online total. I should warn that I realized that the delivery.com menu prices are higher than the menu prices they list on their website. I paid $13.50 for the tricolor lunch when I ordered online and on their online menu it says it's $12. Considering they also have a $15 minimum I'm not thrilled that they'd raise their prices, but I understand that they might lose money on these delivery services and that a lot of restaurants do this.

I have had the same experience is so many places and it is what it is. I travel a little and just like the South is slow and polite and New York is fast and rude, so are the waitresses here sometimes \"rude.\" They aren't really rude if you have thick skin or an understanding. They are attentive, they don't play on their phones or chatter amongst themselves while ignoring you which is a problem I have at most other places.

At $11 for three rolls, a little salad, and a cup of miso soup, few places in town match the amount of food and quality of Mizu's offering. Mizu was reliable at lunch, dinner, and take-out over the four years I lived on Bedford Avenue. I was there more often at lunch than dinner, sat in for dinner more often than I had take-out, and while I have no complaints with the lunch service, dinner service was typically, marginally better. This may be purely a limit of perception on my part, since I'd order nicer things at dinner, like drinks, side dishes, and specialty rolls, which by the quantity of food alone made for a lengthier, more pleasantly paced meal. But I am fairly sure that it's not just my perception in thinking the cheaper, basic rolls (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) that are offered in the lunch special get a little less love in preparation than the specialty rolls. Sometimes the fish in those basic rolls was less than great. More serious sushi joints wouldn't let that happen, they'd show equal consideration to all items on the menu.Still, around this part of restaurant-concentrated Williamsburg, I think this is one of the best places to get a quick, moderately priced, and reliably good lunch - not just among the sushi places, though Mizu is far better and more reliable than Ako, almost just across the street. Cubana Social is another go-to in this category for me (and they run a discount on plantain sides(!) for Yelp check-ins)."}, {"date": "7/20/2014", "star": 4.0, "review": "Solid take out option.

They were tasty without the sesame oil overpowering it and there was a noticeable touch of spice. I sampled the salmon fried rice, which was also nicely done.

The flavors of the fried rice were very good; flavorful, spicy, and delicious. However, the $14 price tag was pretty hefty for such a small portion of rice. The Tom Yum Soup was a bit disappointing, as it was overly acidic and sour due to contrasting acidities from lime and red onion. For a portion to price ratio, I do think this place is overpriced. You can probably get better asian fusion food elsewhere. The drinks here were very delicious, however. The Thai Boxer was very well made, coconut-y in just the right elements.

I've lived within the area for the last several years, but always bypassed this massive and busy restaurant for the smaller, intimate restaurants. Finally, this past Saturday afternoon, I gave Opera a chance and it absolutely did not disappoint.I made a reservation for a table of 11 for a catch-up lunch with some friends and from the get-go I had a good vibe about what was in store. My wife and I arrived about 10 minutes prior to our reservation at 1pm and the very kind hostess informed us that the table would be ready soon, but we let her know that we wanted to wait for some of our tablemates to arrive so we sat in the small waiting area by the door.The moment we arrived we were in awe of just how spacious the restaurant was. It only occupied one floor, but it was vast. It was by far the biggest restaurant we had dined in within Sheepshead Bay. It is definitely the first thing anyone would notice if it was their first time. In addition, the restaurant was very clean-looking and simply decorated. Anyhow, we were finally seated at around 1:20pm, which was a bit later than I anticipated, but it was a non-issue since we were a bit delayed ourselves as a whole. Service was very prompt throughout. We received menus immediately and when we were ready to order the waiters were right on the spot.The menu had very good variety. There was a good selection for breakast, which lasted until 5pm, but an even much larger selection for lunch/dinner entrees. The lunch/dinner menu included hot and cold appetizers, pasta, salads, meat, chicken, seafood entrees and side dishes. A majority of the entrees came with a large house salad and rice/potatoes.First, the appetizers and sides. Everything we ordered was excellent! I mean, even the fries were amazingly hot, crunchy, seasoned and delicious! We also had orders of fried calamari, the mixed meze platter and shepherd salad. I would personally recommend every single one of them. The fried calamari was good. The shepherd salad was really fresh. We couldn't get enough of the mixed meze platter because we only ordered a small and it went so well with the fresh bread provided on the table. Basically, we had to stop ourselves from devouring the bread.As for the entrees, I couldn't speak for everyone else's dishes, but I ordered the Adana Kebab and it was as good as it got. Since I had frequented most of the restaurants within Sheepshead Bay, I was very familiar with what a good Adana Kebab would taste like and this was one of the best ones I had. The 2 skewers of meat were so fresh and tasty. They were grilled to perfection. Although the house salad sat on the same massive plate, there was so much salad that it probably needed a plate of its own. There was a good amount of rice on the plate and it was tasty too. From the looks of it, not only did I love my dish, but everyone else at our table was equally as satisfied with what they ordered too.Now I can see why Opera is always full to the brim whenever we drive by. The restaurant is spacious and clean, the service is fantastic and the food is fresh and delicious. The only knock on the restaurant is not even related to the restaurant, but just the fact that parking could be a challenge in the area because there are so many folks that drive to eat here. All of the street parking on Emmons Avenue are paid parking, but if you circle around there are free spots nearby.It's just an all around excellent restaurant in Brooklyn and one of the best yet.

I haven't been back here for a couple years but this is one of the go-to late night places (opens until 2am) for my girlfriends and I to hang out and grab some dessert over a pot of tea when we're all in town. Love the ambiance and dim lighting - it is so cozy regardless of whether you're in a booth seat along the walls or the tables. It was around midnight when we arrived and with few customers, the waiters were able to be more attentive towards us. In the visit prior to this (also before the renovation), I got an entree and remember it being delicious - clearly I have fond memories of this place. This time, we were all about the desserts (~$8-10) and the lychee infused tea ($10). Just some comments on my most recent order: - Lychee tea- very strong but after a couple of water refills, it tones down; I suggest getting some tea and coffee to compliment your meal (especially since my party ordered so many desserts)- Kunefe - sweet cheese pastry - always a crowd pleaser. This was the reason why we came (plus the fact that it is one of the few places in Sheepshead Bay open past midnight).- Chocolate souffle + scoop of vanilla ice cream - Misnomer in that the it is more cake like and not fluffy. Should be called a molten lava cake instead (unless this is just the Turkish version of a souffle?). While still very decadent and delicious, I was expecting a souffle. - Tres leches cake - While also still very heavy, sweet, and delicious, was expecting tres leches cake which is more cake-y and less flan consistency. Should probably be called a tres leches flan instead (unless this is the Turkish version of a tres leches cake?).

The hostess felt bad & walked us to our booth, keeping an eye on them. We ordered the yogurt dip which was fabulous and rich in taste however, I thought they would've given naan or crackers with it, but I assume the bread they gave after was to be used interchangably with the butter, too. My girl ordered the shrimp scampolini and I ordered the lamb chops (medium well). I felt my lamb chops were more well-done than medium well so it felt rather tougher than I would like. The rice was delicious, perfectly seasoned and salted. The flavors were dynamic and I felt this was a bit mediocre for lamb chops. We both ordered dessert, and commenting on my dessert, I loved the molten chocolate mousse cake. The ice cream to cake ratio was perfect. Sadly, due to how filled up I was, I could not comment more on it. However, it took our waiter 1hr+ to bring the check to us.

One has to consider THAT in regards to the bad experience I had there. I didn't check in with my stylist or anyone else on our team for a recommendation for a new salon to go to, and no one recommended the place to me. I had a meeting to go to in this particular neighborhood and decided just for the heck of it to make an appointment to get my hair cleaned up and trimmed a little bit; so I just looked them up on Yelp, thinking an Aveda Salon \"couldn't be that bad\". So that's on ME. That's MY bad. And I get that. The truth as it turns out is that an Aveda salon REALLY CAN be \"that bad\". Or WORSE. And indeed for me it was. What a bloody nightmare. Long story short, I now literally have SHORT HAIR. Not kidding. I walked in there with about 18 to 22 inches of the luscious locks that the world is accustomed to seeing on me, and midway through the cut I noticed that I suddenly had no freaking hair left -- or to be more precise, it was really freaking short all of a sudden on the sides. Yes, of course I said something. I'm sitting there in the chair, reached up with my hand and started pulling on various areas of my hair feeling how short it was and started exclaiming \"holy shi*t! What the heck?!? Where is all my hair?!? Oh. My. God! We are screwed!\" To which the stylist responded \"don't worry, you still got your hair. It's all in that clip up on top of your head.\" And thank God there was a little clipped up there. But that didn't matter much. Because for the most part the rest of my hair was gone. Cut way too short. I went into a kind of shock and just started trying to brainstorm what the hell we were going to do... a new album coming out, interviews, photo shoots, TV, public appearances.... I was so traumatized that I sat there staring in the mirror mumbling \"Holy crap we are f*^ked! We're f*^ked! This is bad. We. Are. F*^ked!\" She tried explaining herself, saying this and that. But I could clearly see how screwed we were. The right side of my hair was cut about 30-40% MORE than the left side. It looked frightful. So I stopped the cut. Just BAM! Stopped it midstream. But it was too late. I literally had short hair. And not even cool short hair. Just really bad lame looking short hair. And what's so messed up about it is that it's not like there was a miscommunication due to the limitation of language or a misunderstanding. We literally Googled images before we started the cut and glanced at like 15 years worth of Ed Hale hair styles. I chose the one I liked the most (from the Sleep With You album...) and said \"Let's do this one. Yeah, like this.\" So my phone was sitting there at her station opened up to a full screen shot of me with the exact hair cut and style I wanted. All she had to do was just DO THAT. Just copy it. There was absolutely no way anyone could have misunderstood what the customer wanted or messed it up because they were \"seeing something different based on what he said\".... Unless that person just hadn't been trained well enough to be able to see a hair style in a book and emulate it. Which is what they're trained to do. So yeah I'm totally freaked. And more than a little bit pissed. BUT I'll still make it work and look good. Because that's just how I do it . FYI -- Yes. The manager tried to make things alright, but by the time we were at that stage I was in such shock that I wasn't really hearing what she was saying. Just the usual apology bs when a place royally screws up. Nothing could be done by that point. They can't glue hair back on once it's been cut off. We walked out of there shocked stunned and pissed. And most importantly, with a really bad hair cut. PS -- the people there are nice and friendly enough. This review is purely based on the hair cut, not the people.

I can talk with her about my life, job, and so much more. She is so funny herself too. I have a great time getting my haircut because A) I know she does a great job and B) I have a great time while it's happening. More about the salon: I was a little caught off guard with the $40 price when I first started coming because I wasn't used to those prices living outside of NYC but it seems pretty standard for city prices if you ask me now. You can make appointments online via their website, call, or even do a walk-in! I usually make my appointments online because it's easier and I pay half of it through the online reservation. You walk in and check yourself in at the front desk and they offer you tea or water! They also have a closet where you can hang your coats. When you get shampooed they also offer you a brief neck/shoulder massage which can really come in handy when you're having a rough day. The haircut that I get lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to an 1 hour long. FYI: Tips are only in cash so make sure you bring some along beforehand!

I had to wait about 10minutes for my friend to show up but they had no problem seating me before she came so I was super happy about that. Few moments after I got seated they brought out free chips and salsa and they salsa is to die for, is so good, wish I had more chips. I ordered me a house margarita on the rocks, it was good, basic ingredients. Ended up getting the appetizer sampler because for a Mexican place they had some pricey items on the menu and the sampler gave me everything I wanted for only $17. It came with Buffalo wings (the wings were AMAZON), and something I can't pronounce but that was good too. And I had enough left over for work the next day and the flavors were still there.

If I could give this restaurant and staff more stars I would!!! Let me start by saying I am not from New York. I am from Nevada. I have been to Chevy's in California and Nevada. I have been going to Chevy's since they opened. Chevy's used to be my favorite restaurant, It just seemed like it wasn't as tasty as when it first opened up. We don't have a Chevy's anymore in Reno. When we go to California we usually make a stop and go to Chevy's.Jump forward to New York. We walked in were immediately greeted by the hostess who was friendly and kind. She sent us upstairs to our table right away. Our waiter Jorge was so personable, service oriented and on his game! He was amazing and handsome. He got us fresh warm chips and the amazing Salsa. Jorge was attentive and noticed that we finished our chips and brought us more. The chips and salsa are divine. He took our drink order and our food order. He kept a watchful eye on our table and made sure to refill our glasses before even being asked! His personality was great! He was jovial and funny it felt like we had known him for a long time and we were friends! We didn't have to wait long before our food was being servedMy son got the beef enchiladas which he quickly devoured in no time at all. He said they were some of the best enchiladas he had ever had. I got the steak fajitas. OMG the amount of vegetables and perfectly cooked steak was astounding!! I have never gotten that much food on a fajita platter except for my very first visit. These were the BEST FAJITAS I HAVE EVER HAD!!! The flavor of smoky well seasoned juicy meat only left my mouth watering for more. I can still picture and taste the memory in my head and it makes me want to go back to New York Chevy's just to have the juicy, succulent flavorful steak fajitas!! The fresh made flour tortillas make this dish even more amazing!! OH MY WORD!! The flavor and texture of the vegetables was so tasty what and awesome combination. I cannot even accurately describe how wonderful and tasty this was. It has left and imprint on my brain.My husband and daughter got the chicken fajitas. They too were astounded at the amount of vegetables and meat not to mention the FLAVOR!! In my daughter's words the flavor was \"OFF THE HOOK\"!! We kept oohing and aahing over our food! I really can't get over how great it was!! Not to mention our waiter was so unbelievably funny and mindful of our needs!! It was expensive but for what we got and the flavor we didn't mind at all. The amount of food was bang for your buck!!This CHEVY'S has set the GOLD STANDARD!! All of the other Chevy's should take lessons from this Chevy's!! They truly are AMAZING! To the managers of this Chevy's please make sure that Jorge get KUDO's !!We ended up going back the next day with friends to get a quick lunch before heading home. The food from the night before was still on our minds!There were 9 in our party and the hostess was so kind. They seated us off to the side of the bar at two separate tables which we said was fine. Who can blame them 9 people. As soon as we were seated our waitress came up. We informed her that there were two families and could we get two separate checks. She smiled and said \"Sure not a problem.\" Her name was Angela and she too was amazing, kind, friendly and attentive. She immediately brought us warm chips and salsa. She made sure to check on us frequently and always with a smile and a kind word.My family this time got the lunch chicken fajitas. Lunch fajitas are just a smaller portion at a cheaper price. The amount of meat and vegetables on the lunch fajitas were still more than we have ever received from any other Chevy's restaurant. Let me just say that once again we were oohing and aahing over our food! Please someone at corporate look at this restaurant in New York and have the other restaurants in your chain follow suit!! Amazing just amazing!!This truly is the best Chevy's we have ever eaten at!!We would also like for Angela to get Kudo's for being so kind and for taking such amazing care of a table of 9!! Thank you Jorge and Angela so much for your great customer service! I sure hope that corporate sees this and gives you both huge KUDO's!!!Just an FYI they now have Gluten Free items on the menu. If you have never been to a Chevy's and had their fresh salsa and chips, fresh made tortillas or fajitas then you absolutely must give this one a try!!"}, {"date": "10/12/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "Location location location.

Most were also overly sugary (and I am a huge fan of sugar.) It's these two traits that I unfortunately experience in a number of good, but not great, bakeries -- thinking an undercooked cookie can pass for a properly cooked one with a chewy center or over sugaring things to make it sweet instead of using a proper balance of flavors to achieve a rich result.

We'd ordered two rounds of drinks, spaced out by two hours--which is normal, a round per hour.

Other people want this sofa. So order or leave.\" There was no one around us. No one hovering over the sofa-- the bar was not close to being full. No one was looking at us or waiting on us. The bartender was clearly uncomfortable with us, two women, showing affection in his bar. We weren't kissing, not touching in any type of sexual way. Fully clothed, fully appropriate.

My friend and I got the Steak and Fries, and 1/2 roast chicken. We ordered our steak medium rare and came perfectly cooked. Cooked and seared on the outside and pink to bloody on the inside. The steak was pretty bland. But a tiny amount of salt does the trick and makes it taste 10 times better. I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. Many people don't want that much salt on their food. This makes it more flexible; just add salt to taste. But I do wish they'd seasoned it better in terms of flavor. If I wanted steak with salt I can easily achieve that at home. The fries were perfect. Very crunchy. The roast chicken was cleaned and prepared well, but was the same level of bland as the steak. The skin did not roast at all. More like heated by fire from afar. The meat was very dry. You'd get some fatty juiciness and flavor from the skin. That's pretty much it. The sides of spinach and rice paired the chicken very well. The prices are more on the $$-$$$ side. Easily more than the typical $12 lunch. Lunch for 5 came out to a but more than $100.

Someone ordered Bubble Tea with strawberry boba, and the waitress claimed they had no more Strawberry boba, after disappearing to \"ask\". \u00a0We asked for an iced tea and she said well would you like one from the fridge of sodas, since they had no fresh iced tea made. We turned to behind the counter to see three huge containers of Iced tea. Two soups were written on their chalk board as their soup of the day. This was a surprise to me as every time a soup is ever on the board they are always out, as they must seemingly participate in the ration system our nation created during World War II. Well we asked Nancy Drew what soups they had, and she again had to disappear to solve the mystery. Returns to tell us they have no soups either. To our surprise, while the table behind us was being seated, their waitress (who had some sense) informed them of the two soups they were offering for the day. Well now with the birth of the plot of a Scooby Doo cartoon, we needed to solve the soup of the day mystery. \u00a0A member of our party then had to get up and inquire with someone behind the counter if they actually had soup. \"Yes we have two soups today, that is why they are written on the board\"We then inquired about the missing strawberry boba, to which we were told yes we have that. Again, how does a waitress go \"ask\" these questions to be told no we are out. Who was she asking? Ebinzer Scrooge?Someone ordered a BLT with extra bacon, and mentioned they did not mind paying the extra money for the extra bacon. Well the food arrived for only 4/5 people of the party. \u00a0The BLT had no extra bacon. At this point we asked for the additional bacon to which a couple of links were tossed onto the table. How generous. We had to complain again, as we had no silverware, and the easiest order of two pieces of foccacia bread were not served. The woman we spoke to was not super obliging and was kind of like well that is the way it is. Chicken salad sandwich was dryer than the fictional city of Agrabah. My burger looked like it was ripped from the set of the 1997 movie Good Burger. I have had issues with poor service here, and the last few times it had improved, but maybe that crew went back to college as this new squad was lost, maybe they thought they were working at JC Penney and not at a food establishment.

The bad: But if you're looking for an authentic red velvet cake, Billy's won't provide. Unfortunately it's not a red velvet cake. It's a chocolate cake with red dye. For the oreo bar, it's very cakey. It doesn't give me a brownie or cookie bar texture/consistency.

Each slice was $2.75 and I got two which came up to $5.50.There was plenty of seating to wait or dine in. The overall store was very clean and inviting.The first bite of this pizza was heaven.

It was a small square slice with sauce and a blob of fresh mozzarella n the middle with a slice of tomato on top of the cheese and then fresh basil right on top of the tomato. You had to make sure You took a big bite at all times to get some cheese sauce and basil in Your mouth.

I have been back here even though the service when I first went was not good. The food was worth it and sometimes the service was amiable and efficient. But after this last visit, I will not return. We started out the meal having to request the noodles and dipping sauce after sitting there a long while. Then we had to ask for tea which was brought without any sugar (we had to get up and get it ourselves). The place was not busy so I don't understand it. To make matters worse, my glass had a lipstick outline on it! Disgusting and scary. My son's glass also had a lip smudge on it but mine was very obvious. How does that happen? Are they not aware that there are many new competing Asian restaurants nearby? I really don't understand how they can treat their customers this way. I wish that was all that went wrong but it went downhill from there. We ordered a pupu platter for an appetizer, which we usually love, and both pieces of the beef satey were dry and burnt. The fantail shrimp was so old it was inedible. I took a couple of bites and put it down. The pupu costs $15 so it's really not cool to give people stuff they can't eat. I was so disgusted and disappointed. We were really hungry and ended up eating at home. The waiter (guy named Ray - we overheard someone call him) never apologized for the dirty glasses nor did he notice the food left on the pupu. He didn't seem to care at all.

My friends and family have had experiences bad enough that they won't return. I think the positives outweigh the negatives, so I come here monthly. Believe the 5 star reviews. If I got my secondary member correct on my account, got membership cards sent to me, and never went to the Hudson Garden Grill, I'd leave a six star review. They really value making money, which I understand because the upkeep must be a lot for such beautiful gardens. Restricting the closest bathrooms to those who are dining at Hudson Garden Grill ($19 cheese appetizer; $25 mains) is an off-putting thing to do, though.Don't come from the Metro North/MTA side. It's a long train ride from Manhattan, and what used to be the closest restrooms to the Bedford Park entrance are now forbidden to non-restaurant goers. They refused to allow me entry even though I told them it was an emergency. They told me to walk a few minutes down a hill to other bathrooms. \u00a0When I turned to waddle downhill, I soon found myself in a puddle of my own pee. \u00a0They didn't offer help. They just ran away. That's odd. \u00a0Most humans have compassion and don't do that. \u00a0When I finally made it to the bathrooms (down a steep hill that wouldn't be safe for a walker, wheelchair, or person with mobility issues), I found they don't have many stalls, and there was a line when I got there. There's also only one drying device. No towels. There's a line for the single dryer and tissue everywhere because most folks give up.I called to inform management about the situation. When I was done, two women asked me if they could share the bench I was on. It was dedicated to the deceased husband of one of them. I warned them of my non-sanitary situation. They informed me they had gone to that exact same bathroom without issue, and without paying the restaurant, earlier. This made me very sad.My aunt had snooty treatment at NYBG last weekend. We've also had a horrendous waitstaff experience at the Hudson Garden Grill restaurant (they comped part of our meal without us even asking). I've had amazing experiences there, too. It all revolves around getting the one waiter who is good. The Hudson Grill is managed by Starr Management, not the NYBG. \u00a0The Lone Pine Cafe staff is great. Wish they worked at the fancy restaurant.Basically, if I drive there, go through the main entrance by the gift shop, and avoid the Hudson Grill, this is my favorite place in the world. The conservatory can get crowded. That doesn't really bother me, and I still enjoy it despite the crowds. The tour guides are amazing. I don't mind taking the same tour multiple times over the years because there's always something delightful about their passion and I pick up new things every time.I also had to make phonecalls for months just to get my membership card. When I renewed my dual membership, they wouldn't take the old secondary member off despite requests in email, on the phone, and in person. \u00a0My new secondary member couldn't come without me for four months. They said the \"in person\" computer system might not have been syncing correctly with the main system. I also had difficulty correcting my mailing address. \u00a0No additional months were added even though we were without cards for four months and couldn't go to gardens that have a reciprocal membership with NYBG.To actually get my cards with the correct names, I had to give one business-day's advance notice, then come in person. If they aren't picked up one business day after the notice, the cards will be mailed. \u00a0That's quite a lot to ask, especially when the day I had to pick them up was a deluge. \u00a0I came, anyway, at lunch. I waited 30 min for them to tell me the cards were not printed. Then I waited another 15 minutes for them to tell me they could be printed on the spot if I waited. They printed them in an hour, and then I went home. They were courteous throughout this process.They claim a membership-validating email \u00a0works for reciprocal membership gardens. For the record, the only place I got said membership-validating email to work is an arboretum in Hawaii. Other places, including the Brooklyn Botanic Garden refused to honor the email. This still doesn't change the fact the secondary member couldn't go on her own to the NYBG or reciprocal gardens for four months. I've been a member for almost a decade. I can't in good conscience recommend this place any more. \u00a0I'll still go by myself, but a dual membership they can't seem to get right is a waste of time and money."}, {"date": "5/16/2018", "star": 5.0, "review": "Great place to walk around and relax with the family on a nice day.

I went online to the NYBG website to look at the hours of operation for the train show exhibit. It said for the day after Thanksgiving the train show was open from 10am-7pm. I went to buy tickets for the 5:30-5:45pm entrance time for a group of 7 people. We arrived at 5:45 to the ticket booth and got into the exhibit 5-7 minutes after.The whole exhibit was very nice about 3 very large greenhouses full of trains, tracks, plants, and various handcrafted buildings modeled after NYC landmarks. However after the very first building we were being rushed by a security guard yelling to everyone in the room that the train show closes at 6pm. I double checked the website and it still said 7pm. I asked a worker dressed as an engineer what time the train show closed and he said, \"I don't know what that guy is talking about, it closes at 7pm and I'm here til 8pm anyway.\" With that closure my group continued to take our time to enjoy the handiwork of the modeled buildings and take pictures.This security guard continued to follow behind us impatiently rushing us and subtly reminding us that the building was closed. We approached explained that website said the train show closed at 7pm, he disagreed and said it closed at 6. There were other groups in the exhibit but we were around the last ones. We finally arrived in the final room and after taking pictures he rushed us and everyone else out around 6:30. We were upset that we were rudely rushed basically from the moment we arrived and didn't have the time to fully enjoy the exhibit and look at everything. We approached at NYBG employee asking for a manager. He asked us the reason and we told him we wanted to voice our complaint. After hearing our compliant he claimed that he was the manager, which a I highly doubt. We asked if we could have our tickets refunded or be able to come back another day. He said thats not possible. The employee stated that show closed at 6pm and the building was open until 10 for the Bar Car event. We explained that the website stated the train show specifically was open until 7pm and the Bar Car was from 8pm-10pm. And we asked why would they sell tickets for a 5:45 entrance and close at 6?! How are visitors expected to see all of the train exhibit in 15 minutes!??!?! Especially for the price of $30 a ticket! The \"manager\" said there was nothing he can do and that they technically gave us extra time since they close at 6 and we got out at 6:30.The exhibit and venue were very nice but the experience and staff left a horrible taste in my mouth. Not only were the hours of operation falsely advertised, the scheduling is disorganized, the security staff was rude, and the so called \"manager\" was uncooperative and couldn't even give us truthful answers.Be weary when you come here for ticketed events and choose an early ticket time."}, {"date": "11/29/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDI get a little apprehensive venturing into reviewing exquisite cultural institutions like the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx because I am, for better or worse, a restaurant reviewer.

He told me about a fresh mozzarella cheese he made and how good it came out (if I recall, this conversation came out of a discussion about aquafaba [bean water -- a surprising cooking miracle for vegans]). As such, I asked if there was some appetizer (which I ate after my meal, but whatever) he could make with it. I was hoping for something warm and melty, since -- as a vegan -- getting good, warm, melty cheese is pretty rare. What I got was -- more or less -- a bruschetta. OK, well, that was still quite good (I get why a chef would send this out over something cooked; the purpose was for me to experience the mozzarella in its purest form).Another important result of my conversation w/the owner: He's aware he lost a LOT of business thanks to that awful waitress from a few years ago. It seems to me he's since ensured that the service is impeccable...and it was.And, just a general note for Yelp users (that I will now put in any reviews I write): Pics of your food are almost always useless. Show me the place. Give me a sense of the setting, tone, feel, size, location. Unless the presentation is amazing or there's something special about how the food looks, those photos are useless."}, {"date": "3/29/2017", "star": 4.0, "review": "Really small, cozy place with some interesting food choices. \u00a0Personally I love their rotating vege bean soups. \u00a0With a crusty baguette it's a meal. \u00a0Nice drink choices as well. \u00a0Service can be a little slow (but always friendly and attentive) so if you're in a hurry it's probably not for you. \u00a0It's more of a relaxed \"zen\" atmosphere. \u00a0Don't miss the really neat David Bowie sketch on the front of the bathroom door. \u00a0Legend has it that a customer drew it on a table cover the day Bowie died. \u00a0The restaurant kept it and framed it...nice touch! \u00a0That's the kind of place it is."}, {"date": "3/26/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "After 8 pm on a Sunday, I called to see if they would still deliver. \u00a0They did, but I had no idea what I could order that was both gluten free and vegan.The wonderful person who answered the phone helped me out, recommended what was good. \u00a0I ordered the gf/v meatloaf and my daughter ordered the Thai-ginger BBQ seitan (not gf). \u00a0Both were generous servings, filling, and delicious!I also had the vanilla milkshake with whipped cream, which was amazing, and vegan!!!Delivery came via uber, and was fast and polite."}, {"date": "3/26/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "I've loved this place since they were on Hudson St. \u00a0The food never fails, it's always delicious. \u00a0The service can be a bit slow sometimes, but there's only 1 waiter for the entire restaurant. \u00a0They keep having deals on Groupon, etc. \u00a0I hope they'll stay open!"}, {"date": "3/19/2017", "star": 2.0, "review": "This restaurant was a disappointment.

We ordered just two dishes and a juice. 20 mins later the waitress tells us that the quinoa will take an extra 15 mins to make and do we want to switch to rice. We specifically had ordered quinoa to avoid eating rice and she should have told us about it when we placed the order 20 mins before. 40 mins after we sat down, still no juice. 1 and 10 mins hour after we sat down, our food arrived. I've never waited 50 mins for food AFTER we placed the order and 70 mins after we were seated. And there was no real acknowledgement of how awfully late their food arrived. The staff couldn't care less. Had to ask for water refill after trying to get the waitress' attention for 15 mins. The. We asked for hot sauce and waited another 15 mins for it (Tobasco in a little cup). Oh and we got charged extra for the quinoa which of course was never communicated to us. While their food may be good and it's a cute little space, it's definitely not worth the ridiculous wait.

There was one server and one person in the kitchen. They make everything to order and the food reflects that. It is delicious! I ordered the Nama Gori Kale Caesar salad because there is a law in the life of me which states that if there is a Caesar salad on the vegan menu, I shall order it. It was the bomb. Mama's No-Soy Meatballs were next on the list and they were so delicious I could have them every night. I dare any carnivore to taste them and not think they're as good as or better than actual meatballs. The sauce is the killer bonus. So good.The Thai Ginger BBQ Seitan was also divine. The BBQ sauce is delish and if you order veggie sides it's a yummy option to combine with those as well. My mom got the Lentil Meatloaf which was so \u00a0big I got to share half of it and again it was great. Mind you, this is not a low-calorie restaurant. The food is heavy but that's a good thing.

The french toast is as awesome as it sounds with the outside having crispy parcels of banana bombs. The blueberry compote is perfect and not at all too sweet. It also doesn't soak into the bread so the flavors remain separate if you want them to (which someone like me loves because I can enjoy them separately as well as together).

It's been a few months since I've been to this place and my memory is fading fast. Read the Yelp reviews that this restaurant was pretty good. Since it's nearby, gave it a try. Made a big mistake coming here. Place was busy on Friday 7 pm. Waited a bit for a table. Wait staff (2) looked understaffed. Waitress was answering phones, taking orders and cleaning tables. Got a table, placed the order and took awhile for the food to come. Are they understaffed in the kitchen as well? We ordered a sushi roll with salmon. \u00a0My wife says the salmon is not sushi grade. I couldn't tell because it was served with a spicy sauce. I had a fried noodle dish w/supposedly Filet Mignon beef in it. I think it was a $13 dish (memory still fading). When it arrived I was like WOW, noodles were almost submerged in the stir fry sauce. I expected to see that in a run down chinese restaurant, not a japanese restaurant. Wife tells me the staff are from a Province in China that are known to be low class and sneaky and they're occupying many areas in Brooklyn getting free food stamps and medical attention while the middle class are funding them. Just to be fair other ethnicities are doing it too. \u00a0Anyways, back to the restaurant.. NOPE, not going back ever. None of the food we had stood out.

I went on a weekend day for lunch and there was no one in the place and our service was great. The second time I ate here was during an evening out with a group of friends. We waited for about 30 minutes for a server just to bring water and take our orders. Then we waited another 45 minutes for out first round of sushi rolls to come out. I watched how several to go orders were being made and picked up by the delivery man. It seemed that this place thrives on their delivery orders and treats the actual dinning in patrons with little to no regard.

One way to regard a reputable Japanese restaurant is by their rice and sashimi. I have been to Japan and worked for 5 years in midtown at a Japanese company. I know what i'm talking about. Really irks me how these Chinese cut and prepare the raw fish. I often order raw fish because its a good indicator of quality. Fresh fish means good management of everything. Quality is important when ordering sushi.Its not like hot dishes that destroy bacteria. Raw fish is a different ballgame. I suppose if you're a mediocre customer of Japanese cuisine, you'd find this place apt. If you're looking for reasonable quality sushi, id just head off to ShopRite in Hylan Blvd. The cook's Chinese too, but the quality is better. I'll downgrade Osaka in Forest Avenue.They've succumbed to cheap rice. But their sashimi is still good. There is no genuine Japanese restaurant in STaten Island.

I've eaten here about 20+ times and I've only gotten bad service once from this older lady, which I never ever saw again. Guess she got fired. They can slow down quite a bit if there's a ton of people at the restaurant, as their sushi bar can only fit three people working at the same time. If it's packed, expect slow service, since the guy next to you probably ordered 3 plates worth of rolls and they're only human. Happens during dinner times.Food: The sushi is pretty decent for price to quality ratio. I suggest eating inside as you get the most for your money, since they discount for eating in (the rolls are %50 off, but they took down the signs since then, it made the place look cheap and I think they built up a customer base at this point so people know about it already) but if you order take out, you get charged more. Drinks: They don't have a full bar, but they have some interesting choices, like Sake and Import beer, which is somewhat rare, especially in the Grasmere area. Give their drinks a try!It makes sense. If you're really hungry and you know it, do the buffet, guarantee that you'll be full afterwards.

And I have had better at other places for a LOT less.Stay away from this place. If you want to ride for free to enjoy the view, then go ahead and order drinks only.

When I actually made the reservation they said it was only for fleet week and nothing was included. I even gave the promo code on the website and they just said \"we don't do that\". That should have been my first clue but I managed to argue a bit of a discount.On the boat was a little better but you could tell the staff knew that we had paid less and hadn't gotten the extras. We felt like second class because we would get served last, have our plates left and have to ask multiple times for things. The other tables around us by the windows got far better service. The food was meh but came out cold which is never acceptable. While the view was beautiful I would not recommend this to anyone.

We parked the car and walked to the ticket booth where we were again greated by a smiling face eager to assist. We recieved our tickets and aboard we went. My first impression of the yacht was pure excitement The yacht was clean (inside and out) and it smelled very pleaseant. \u00a0Once we entered we were greated by very pleasant staff members and showed our table, although I wanted a window seat (they were sold out and an additional 80 bucks) \u00a0we were seated at an aisle table which to my surprise my wife actually preferred the spot over the window. \u00a0FOOD: we started out with white or wheat bread and butter AMAZING...then followed by a lobster hordourve my wife said she could have eatten it all night but I passed as I was saving my appetite....next came the salad round eh not to big on veggies so not the highlight but to the entree I ordered the chicken dinner which was well seasoned and moist which was served with risotto and steamed veggies AMAZING The wife had steak and potatoes, she couldnt get enough and that says alot because she never orders steak, it also was tender and well seasoned. Then came dessert, the absolute best hands down cheesecake in the world! After dinner they give the guests complimentary champagne and even accommodated my pregnant wife with ginger ale, was truly a nice touch. Dinner price is included with the ticket price. Drinks are extra and will be billed at the end of the tour. AMBIANCE: although it was a formal dinner the atmosphere was very relaxing wasnt stuffy they had a dj that started off very rocky, but soon found his niche and played a mix for just about everyone. The dance floor was packed with people having a great time. \u00a0The decks were well stocked with adequate seating for guests and the view of Manhattan/brooklyn was absolutely breathtaking. Also, you are not required to sit and wait for food you can walk around and enjoy the tour and hot food will be served once you return. The bathrooms were clean and well kept. Not a place for children however there were two kids aboard. CON: they expect to be given gratuity on the total ticket price versus just your drinks. Example ticket price 250 + drinks 50 = gratuity on a 300 versus 50 bill. Not a deal breaker but I typically pay for service and we enjoyed the service.

Service was fine.The only deceptive part of the cruise was the attempt to obtain double tipping.The way they work it is this: when you reserve your non refundable tickets to dinner you pay on top of the advertised dinner cruise price fix price of $107 an \"administrative service charge\" of 20%. So now the price for four is about $500 without any extras such as cocktails or wine. But don't haha think this service charge is for any dinner service. Lol. \u00a0At the end of the dinner even if you order no additional items you will get a bill with \"suggested\" tips of $60 $80 $100 or whatever, depending if you had extra drinks. And you thought that you had paid the service charge! Haha lol.Since the person who ordered the tickets was genuinely misled on what a service charge of 20% was for in the first place, she declined to pay any additional service charge. According to the manager, the servers are forbidden to explain the distinction between service charges.An additional tip is to bring ear plugs as the music gets much louder as the evening and the music decades progress.

This is not a casual attire cruise at dinner. Men are required to wear a dress shirt and women are asked to wear evening or business attire. (Sneakers, shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops and tank tops not permitted on-board at any time). My husband made a huge mistake by not buying tickets directly through World Yacht -- instead he purchased through a vendor (Viator). \u00a0Not only did he pay more but our seats were lousy \u00a0-- appreciate him trying but those of you considering buying this package go directly through World Yacht and request a table with a view. The cruise begins at Pier 81 with a voyage down the Hudson river with breathtaking views of NYC at night. (Cruise begins at 7:00 pm and ends at 10:00 pm). There was a live band playing everything from Sinatra to Marley. The dinner comprised of a four course meal all made with fresh ingredients. Not sure if the menu is the same for every cruise but we were offered the following -- we could choose 1 of each:1) Amuse Bouche: we were given a fresh squeezed watermelon shot2) Appetizers: Grilled Vegetable Timbale or Baby Arugula Salad or Maryland Lump Crab Cake 3) Entrees: Atlantic Salmon, Lemon Thyme Chicken Breast or New York Strip or \u00a0Garganelli Pasta4) Desserts: Chocolate Ganache or New York Cheesecake (they can accommodate special diet request as well as vegetarian items)The food was surprisingly good. My husband ordered the crab cake, salmon, and cheesecake. I went with the baby arugula salad, lemon thyme chicken breast and cheesecake, While waiting for each course to be served -- we would head to the outdoor deck to take in the sights of the gorgeous NYC skyline. After dinner was served we danced a little to the live band but ultimately settled in on the outdoor deck that is furnished with comfortable over sized chairs. Only negative -- they still allow people to smoke on the outdoor decks. Hard to enjoy your glass of champagne or wine when there is smoke being blown in your face. The cruise takes you around the tip of Manhattan up the East River passing under the beautiful Brooklyn Bridge --- then heading towards the Statue of Liberty and back to Pier 81. Parking is available on the pier for $35. We chose to park at a garage very close to the pier for about $25 (not worth the $10 savings to walk that far to the closest garage). Would we do this again? Absolutely, we had a wonderful time --- but will book through World Yacht requesting window seating and will pay extra to park on the pier. $127.00 a person ages 12 and up.

The boat ride and the nice views were included, and everything else (including food) had to be paid for on-board. I had fun on this cruise! My friend and I had the pleasure of meeting the \"party crew\" and DJs of the radio station, and talking with them briefly. We also participated in the \"Guess The Number and Spin The Wheel\" game, which was fun too. The cruise itself sailed at a smooth (or close-to) speed, and went toward the Statue of Liberty. After that, it turned around and sailed back to the pier. Ahh, the views were awesome! I had the pleasure of taking photos of certain spots, and let's not forget about the panoramas! :) Seriously, who doesn't like looking at the views? :P The weather was nice for this event. The ship itself looked okay too.When it comes to rating cruises of ANY kind, I consider the food and drink qualities, and on-board pricing. Unfortunately, my low rating is the result of that. We didn't eat dinner prior to boarding, so we decided to eat here. We paid $9 for Chicken Fingers with Fries from their limited menu. For a price that high, we expected the food to be really good. While it was edible, the quality was disappointing. The chicken itself was okay (wasn't sure if this was frozen before), but the fries were not fresh, as they were soggy and re-heated. No other sides were included.If that wasn't insulting enough, how about the drinks? $3 for a CUP of soda (which I got). WOW, I've been on other cruises before, and they give you more (a can) for the same price. Oh and if you wanted water, you had to pay $3 for that too (a cup!). On other cruises, it was available at no extra charge (excluding bottles). Want beer or a mixed drink? $9 and more! Yeah, I paid less for all of that stuff (or received more for same price) when I was on another cruise line last month. So yeah, didn't buy any alcoholic drinks for that reason.

Our waiter never asked if we wanted another drink - we had to flag someone down to ask for another glass of wine. \u00a0 After that glass, we again were not offered. \u00a0Dinner service was slower than usual, which is fine because we're on a boat, and I would expect that dinner would last the entire cruise. \u00a0What really disappointed me though was that the DJ started playing really loud music right after we finished our salads - making any table conversation impossible. \u00a0This was not a \"club\" boat, and my expectations were that we would be able to have a nice conversation and catch up with my mom. \u00a0The pounding music lasted for the last two hours of the cruise, so we're basically eating our meal in silence, and every once and a while trying to gesture something or other. \u00a0 If I had known the music was going to be so loud, I would not have booked this ship. I'm in my thirties, so loud music, when appropriate and I'm expecting it, doesn't bother me, but for a \"dinner cruise\", I would expect to actually be able to enjoy dinner and the company of my companions. \u00a0Had service been a little faster (both food and drinks), we may have been able to escape to the upper deck so that we could talk. \u00a0But, it didn't work out. \u00a0The other thing that made me absolutely miserable is that the ship was freezing. \u00a0It was nice to sit by the window, but the draft was terrible. \u00a0When I finally did go upstairs for a few minutes while the bill was being paid, I realized that the heat wasn't on throughout the ship. \u00a0Somewhat minor point, but you combine loud music, slow food and drink service and being cold, it was just miserable. \u00a0I'm not a complainer, but this experience was torture. \u00a0I couldn't wait to get off the ship."}, {"date": "2/17/2013", "star": 2.0, "review": "This review is for the Valentines dinner cruise we went on February 16th, 2013.Let me start off by saying that I have been on this cruise a few times in the past. \u00a0On this particular night they were all setup with a Valentines theme. \u00a0There was a private party on the top floor so all of the Valentines couples were restricted to the lower level.We were seated in the rear of the boat by the bar. \u00a0Strike one. \u00a0If you plan on booking dinner reservations on this boat, make sure you request to sit away from the bar, or upgrade to a window seat. \u00a0Very typical NY seating, basically you are on top of the table next to you. \u00a0Don't expect anything spacious or private.Our server's name was Margarita. \u00a0She was ok. \u00a0Not too swift with the english language, but she had a bubbly personality. \u00a0She did however look swamped with too many tables, and on more then one occasion took forever with our overpriced drinks. \u00a0Be prepared to pay about $15 for a watered down mixed drink and almost $9 for a beer.This is a set menu except for your entree. \u00a0Amuse Bouche - We started our meal off with smoked salmon tartar with cucumber and citrus. \u00a0It was actually very pleasant. \u00a0Had a nice smoked flavor. \u00a0Appetizer - \u00a0The souffl\u00e9 of corn with smoked oysters was pretty bad. \u00a0It had the consistency of a dunkin donuts corn muffin with some chewy oyster pills stuffed in there. \u00a0The bacon bits and sour cream on top didn't really help it out that much.Entree - Me and my girlfriend both had the hand cut Filet Mignon. \u00a0It was cooked to perfection in a cabernet demi glace sauce with a potato puree. \u00a0This was the best thing on our menu. \u00a0It wasn't the best steak I ever had by no means, but it was decent compared to everything else we ate. \u00a0The string bean were still a little frozen, so we just kind of skipped those.Dessert - The warm chocolate ganache cake was nice and warm with a gooey cr\u00e9me anglaise in the middle, topped with some cold whipped cream. \u00a0Mine was cooked to perfection, but my date's was overcooked and crumby. \u00a0After you go around the statue of liberty the DJ tries to pick up the music from elevator to top 40. \u00a0I have been around many good DJ's and this guy isn't one of them. \u00a0He was blending dance records with slow records with records that just didn't make sense. \u00a0People would dance, then sit down, then get up and groups, then cha cha slide, it was rather ridiculous. \u00a0I must say the DJ was a major downer, and I feel they should invest a couple of more bucks into somebody decent. \u00a0Overall, I would not recommend this dinner cruise to anyone. \u00a0As I mentioned before, I have been on this boat a few times. \u00a0None of those times really stand out to me. \u00a0This time it did stand out but not in a good way. \u00a0Do yourself and go to a good restaurant instead, followed by a good NY lounge. \u00a0This way you will be guaranteed good food, music, and dancing. \u00a0The only thing your basically paying for on that cruise is the view and boat fuel. \u00a0Skip it."}, {"date": "2/4/2013", "star": 5.0, "review": "I had a blast cruising around the Statue of Liberty in this boat!The ship was reserved for my group and we got to spend the entire evening dining and partying on the ship.

Since I didn't see this $20 service fee policy on the menu I am just curious if this is some trick that they play with all customers."}, {"date": "8/17/2012", "star": 4.0, "review": "My mother had done the dinner cruise with friends back in 2005 for a milestone birthday celebration and really enjoyed it. \u00a0At the time I was still quite young, but the pictures she brought back of the moonlit water, the women in sparkling dresses, and her descriptions of the sumptuous food made a lasting impact on me. \u00a0Fast forward seven years -- now I'm about to turn eighteen, a milestone of my own, and as a gift my father has generously invited me for a dinner out on the boat.The evening was paced beautifully; we arrived at 6:00 for our tickets, but remained on the pier taking pictures and enjoying the evening until about 6:30. \u00a0Once we boarded, we were seated immediately in the lower dining area (there are two) and our orders taken. \u00a0What's nice is that you can leave your table at any time to explore the boat or go up on deck (on the topmost deck they have a little lounge area and a bar for cocktails) and the waiters will refrain from bringing your next course until you are seated again. \u00a0In this way the pacing is set by the diners; we saw some people who had finished their meal in its entirety within the first hour and a half, and others who were still enjoying dessert as we approached the pier.In regards to the food -- it was very good. \u00a0We were brought complimentary bread to start, a choice of multigrain or white rolls (I chose multigrain, my father went with white) and fresh whipped butter. \u00a0Our amuse bouche came next, a buttered crostini topped with a thin spread of gorgonzola and a ripe peach slice. \u00a0The salty bite of the cheese contrasted well with the sweet tang of the fruit. \u00a0For an appetizer, I had the salmon cured with soy and fresh ginger, served over arugula with creme fraiche. \u00a0The salmon portion was generous and of good quality, and though it was a bit on the salty side it was lovely together with the greens and creme fraiche.My entree was pan-roasted duck breast with a saffron risotto cake, blackberry beurre rouge, and sauteed broccoli rabe. \u00a0My duck was cooked well (perhaps a little overdone for some tastes, but I was fine with it) with just enough delicious duck fat, but the blackberry beurre rouge was just divine and I could have done with a gravy boat full of it. \u00a0The risotto cake was the meal's low point -- it was a tad dry, not creamy as I had imagined, and tasted to me a bit like 'ready-rice' to tell the truth. \u00a0The broccoli rabe was cooked al dente and was buttery and delicious, just how I like my greens. \u00a0For dessert I chose the chocolate ganache cake with a raspberry sauce. \u00a0The cake was a standard chocolate 'lava-style' cake, done well. \u00a0The cake to ganache ratio was about 30:70, which was just fine by me, as I am an insatiable chocoholic. \u00a0The raspberry sauce was a tad watery and I could have taken or left it, but the whipped cream on the side was light and went well with the rich cake.I must say, though, part of what made the evening was the gorgeous weather we experienced. \u00a0Though it cooled off a bit once the sun went down, the temperature was perfect, the water was calm and the sky was crystal-clear. \u00a0The views of the Manhattan skyline at night were breathtaking.The bottom line: if you're looking for the best of New York's fine dining, you may be disappointed. \u00a0But if you come with an open mind, relax, and allow yourself to enjoy the evening - and the views from the top deck - the cruise can be a wonderful experience."}, {"date": "7/21/2012", "star": 4.0, "review": "I had a great experience with World Yacht Cruises.

We were fortunate enough to get a table by the window, but there are wall to wall windows, so you can see the views of the skyline and the statue from any table. \u00a0The stairs leading to/from the upper/outside deck are a bit steep, but the staff was readily available-- and proactive-- about assisting people who looked as if they might require \u00a0a hand to steady them. \u00a0 There is live piano music, which made the atmosphere feel more formal than it actually was. \u00a0I will say that I was disappointed that the dress code was not adhered to, nor enforced by the staff. \u00a0Some parties were dressed in appropriate brunch attire, some were in ratty jeans and t-shirts. \u00a0I would have liked it if there was a uniform application of the expectation, but, hey, I'm kind of old school when it comes to that sort of thing. \u00a0The wait staff was attentive and polite, always refilling coffee/waters and asking if you would like another drink \u00a0(one drink choice is included besides coffee/tea/water-- you can choose from several types of juice, soda, or a mimosa; \u00a0Your refills, additional drinks, and any liquor or wine that you decide to drink are extra, and billed to you at the completion of your meal. \u00a0The meal is buffet style, and there is a separate buffet set up on each of the dining levels (there are two dining levels). \u00a0The breakfast bar included fruit, bagels, toast, eggs, muffins/pastries, sausage, bacon, and waffles. \u00a0The lunch options included garden and caesar salads, green beans, stuffed chicken breast, and fish. \u00a0Dessert was brownies, mini cheesecakes, bread pudding, and a chilled oreo cookie topped chocolate pudding. \u00a0It is all you can eat, and every time I walked past the buffet, the staff was refilling/tending to it, so people were able to eat as much as they wanted to, for the entire 2.5 hour trip, if they chose to. \u00a0 The temperature of the food was maintained appropriately, and the taste was, for the most part, typical of buffet style meals, which is to say from my own opinion, a bit bland, so as to appeal to the broadest amount of palates. \u00a0Several parties celebrated birthdays and special events and the (singing) staff brought cake to their tables (this costs extra). \u00a0 I'm not big the waitstaff singing \"happy birthday\", but it was as tasteful as possible. \u00a0Food service began right after boarding, and people wasted no time lining up. \u00a0There appeared to be very little organization to the line, and the staff was not directing it, so we just waited until the majority of the other people had filled their plates before going up for our own food. \u00a0The restrooms were clean, and the tile work was gorgeous. \u00a0The dining decks are completely contained, so you don't have to worry about being out in the cold/sun/rain/whatever during your meal. \u00a0The upper deck is open with several seating areas. \u00a0The captain slows down when you approach the Statue of Liberty, and there is ample time to get photos. \u00a0Also, a staff member circulates and offers to take your photo for a fee (I believe it was $40 for 4 photos). \u00a0The views of the NYC skyline are breathtaking. \u00a0There were very few children on board, and none in high chairs. \u00a0A 2.5 hour meal/cruise in a contained area is asking a lot of young children, though, and I certainly wouldn't have wanted to bring my toddler along for this outing. \u00a0Little one's who get antsy will detract from your experience, and certainly, the dining experience of others. It's a big boat, but it's really a floating restaurant, plus there's the safety concerns of being on a boat. \u00a0Your kid can't run around freely, so you'll want to keep that in mind if you're ready to book this with kids in tow. \u00a0We enjoyed ourselves, and received good service. \u00a0 I'm not sure I'd want to do it again the next time we're in town, but it was a nice, relatively short, excursion to do once, or once in a while."}, {"date": "4/2/2012", "star": 1.0, "review": "Way too expensive for value.

If I could give them 0 stars I WOULD! Back in August I was celebrating my first wedding anniversary, and my husband and I had been saving up for some time so we could do something nice. My husband was unemployed at the time, and myself, an artist, I don't make much money. My husband and I could only afford their brunch cruise (the cheapest one they have), but a moment after we had made the reservation we noticed we made it for the day AFTER our anniversary, as the Saturday of our anniversary did NOT serve brunch. Silly mistake, so within 2 minutes of making the reservation we called but they're calling center was closed. We left a message AND sent out an e-mail saying we wouldn't be coming for our brunch, we made an honest mistake, please help us change the date. Finally on Monday I was able to talk with a rep who said they couldn't help unless we paid another $40 in fees for the change. WTF, it's not like you went out and bought caviar on our behalf, we LITERALLY called 2 min after purchase and said we WONT be there. $40 is well worth a week of groceries, and we literally couldn't afford to pay a fee. After all at the time we lived paycheck to paycheck, or in this case commission to commission (crossing our fingers they would keep coming). Frustrated, my husband called back and the rep suggested to us to tell our bank it was FRAUD. Yes, FRAUD. He said that is how we would get our money back. My husband, 22 at the time, didn't think about the consequences and followed the rep's \"advice\". Of course this slapped us back in the face, as the company had records of the whole thing. We were recharged the $124 and now stuck. At this point I got in contact with a man named Steve, the accountant for World Yacht. I have to say this guy is really patient and he did go out of his way for me. Probably the only good thing about the company. He tried to work to get my fee down from $40 to $20 as a courtesy and I believe to cover the mistake of a dumb rep, but by the time he got the OK, it was the weekend of Halloween. I was going to be out of town that weekend, I had already bought the tickets, booked the hotel, etc, but Steve informed me that it was the LAST DAY World Yacht would be sailing FOR THE YEAR. I literally had to screw over my family and friends and my visit or pay and extra $20 for a service I had already paid for. I chose family.Fast forward to 2011 \u00a0and the saga continues.

I spoke with Steve again who was willing to help, but reluctant because of the time (Sorry I waited so long to call you, YOU WERE CLOSED FOR MONTHS!! my bad!). He told me to call a Ms. Campbell who was extremely RUDE with me. I was speaking to her all nice, and you could just hear her tone of voice slowly escalate, I was just thinking the whole time \"What's her problem? I'm obviously not giving her attitude, I'm calling for help!\". Eventually my tone changed due to her nasty way of treating me, and we literally got NO WHERE. She told me she wouldn't be able to help me at all, even if I paid my fee because too much time passed. WTF! Your policy says that I have to pay a fee for changes, there is NO MENTION of a time frame. BS LADY, BS!!! She ended the conversation telling me to deal with my bank about it, which I told her I've already done 2 claims, the first one being fraud, suggested by one of YOUR employees. This lady literally had no remorse for me, no patience (as she was hostile after her first sentence on the phone...even though we never spoke before) or a sense of customer service.

The selection was above average. 3-4 salads, veggies, potatoes, beef, turkey, and salmon along with an assortment of desserts. However the real downfall was the temperature of the food. I realize it was a buffet, but it was luke-warm at best. Nothing really kills the mood like semi-cold potatoes and chewy veggies.  The drinks: ok selection. Nothing that's going to blow you away. About on par with the buffet.The views: perhaps the best part of the cruise. However, is suggest a regular cruise with no food. You're better off grabbing street meat and saving your money on the buffet.The service: meh. Understaffed. Not much more to be said. Very friendly staff but they needed 2-3 more people in my opinion.Overall, it was ok. At $75 a person, I expected more.

When I actually made the reservation they said it was only for fleet week and nothing was included. I even gave the promo code on the website and they just said \"we don't do that\". That should have been my first clue but I managed to argue a bit of a discount.On the boat was a little better but you could tell the staff knew that we had paid less and hadn't gotten the extras. We felt like second class because we would get served last, have our plates left and have to ask multiple times for things. The other tables around us by the windows got far better service.

We parked the car and walked to the ticket booth where we were again greated by a smiling face eager to assist. We recieved our tickets and aboard we went. My first impression of the yacht was pure excitement The yacht was clean (inside and out) and it smelled very pleaseant. \u00a0Once we entered we were greated by very pleasant staff members and showed our table, although I wanted a window seat (they were sold out and an additional 80 bucks) \u00a0we were seated at an aisle table which to my surprise my wife actually preferred the spot over the window. \u00a0FOOD: we started out with white or wheat bread and butter AMAZING...then followed by a lobster hordourve my wife said she could have eatten it all night but I passed as I was saving my appetite....next came the salad round eh not to big on veggies so not the highlight but to the entree I ordered the chicken dinner which was well seasoned and moist which was served with risotto and steamed veggies AMAZING The wife had steak and potatoes, she couldnt get enough and that says alot because she never orders steak, it also was tender and well seasoned. Then came dessert, the absolute best hands down cheesecake in the world! After dinner they give the guests complimentary champagne and even accommodated my pregnant wife with ginger ale, was truly a nice touch. Dinner price is included with the ticket price. Drinks are extra and will be billed at the end of the tour. AMBIANCE: although it was a formal dinner the atmosphere was very relaxing wasnt stuffy they had a dj that started off very rocky, but soon found his niche and played a mix for just about everyone. The dance floor was packed with people having a great time. \u00a0The decks were well stocked with adequate seating for guests and the view of Manhattan/brooklyn was absolutely breathtaking. Also, you are not required to sit and wait for food you can walk around and enjoy the tour and hot food will be served once you return. The bathrooms were clean and well kept. Not a place for children however there were two kids aboard. CON: they expect to be given gratuity on the total ticket price versus just your drinks. Example ticket price 250 + drinks 50 = gratuity on a 300 versus 50 bill. Not a deal breaker but I typically pay for service and we enjoyed the service.

The DJ plays recorded music. Nothing live. And there dance floor is small and under utilized. I have enjoy salsa, tango, west coast swing and other dances but this is more for the children to run around the tiny dance floor to mediocre recorded music.The tour around was nice. \u00a0Although the photography comes up to take a photo of your table when there is nothing in view outside and the photo doesn't capture the view.

Service was fine.The only deceptive part of the cruise was the attempt to obtain double tipping.The way they work it is this: when you reserve your non refundable tickets to dinner you pay on top of the advertised dinner cruise price fix price of $107 an \"administrative service charge\" of 20%. So now the price for four is about $500 without any extras such as cocktails or wine. But don't haha think this service charge is for any dinner service. Lol. \u00a0At the end of the dinner even if you order no additional items you will get a bill with \"suggested\" tips of $60 $80 $100 or whatever, depending if you had extra drinks. And you thought that you had paid the service charge! Haha lol.Since the person who ordered the tickets was genuinely misled on what a service charge of 20% was for in the first place, she declined to pay any additional service charge. According to the manager, the servers are forbidden to explain the distinction between service charges.An additional tip is to bring ear plugs as the music gets much louder as the evening and the music decades progress.

This is not a casual attire cruise at dinner. Men are required to wear a dress shirt and women are asked to wear evening or business attire. (Sneakers, shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops and tank tops not permitted on-board at any time). My husband made a huge mistake by not buying tickets directly through World Yacht -- instead he purchased through a vendor (Viator). \u00a0Not only did he pay more but our seats were lousy \u00a0-- appreciate him trying but those of you considering buying this package go directly through World Yacht and request a table with a view. The cruise begins at Pier 81 with a voyage down the Hudson river with breathtaking views of NYC at night. (Cruise begins at 7:00 pm and ends at 10:00 pm). There was a live band playing everything from Sinatra to Marley. The dinner comprised of a four course meal all made with fresh ingredients. Not sure if the menu is the same for every cruise but we were offered the following -- we could choose 1 of each:1) Amuse Bouche: we were given a fresh squeezed watermelon shot2) Appetizers: Grilled Vegetable Timbale or Baby Arugula Salad or Maryland Lump Crab Cake 3) Entrees: Atlantic Salmon, Lemon Thyme Chicken Breast or New York Strip or \u00a0Garganelli Pasta4) Desserts: Chocolate Ganache or New York Cheesecake (they can accommodate special diet request as well as vegetarian items)The food was surprisingly good. My husband ordered the crab cake, salmon, and cheesecake. I went with the baby arugula salad, lemon thyme chicken breast and cheesecake, While waiting for each course to be served -- we would head to the outdoor deck to take in the sights of the gorgeous NYC skyline. After dinner was served we danced a little to the live band but ultimately settled in on the outdoor deck that is furnished with comfortable over sized chairs. Only negative -- they still allow people to smoke on the outdoor decks. Hard to enjoy your glass of champagne or wine when there is smoke being blown in your face. The cruise takes you around the tip of Manhattan up the East River passing under the beautiful Brooklyn Bridge --- then heading towards the Statue of Liberty and back to Pier 81. Parking is available on the pier for $35. We chose to park at a garage very close to the pier for about $25 (not worth the $10 savings to walk that far to the closest garage). Would we do this again? Absolutely, we had a wonderful time --- but will book through World Yacht requesting window seating and will pay extra to park on the pier. $127.00 a person ages 12 and up.

The boat ride and the nice views were included, and everything else (including food) had to be paid for on-board. I had fun on this cruise! My friend and I had the pleasure of meeting the \"party crew\" and DJs of the radio station, and talking with them briefly. We also participated in the \"Guess The Number and Spin The Wheel\" game, which was fun too. The cruise itself sailed at a smooth (or close-to) speed, and went toward the Statue of Liberty. After that, it turned around and sailed back to the pier. Ahh, the views were awesome! I had the pleasure of taking photos of certain spots, and let's not forget about the panoramas! :) Seriously, who doesn't like looking at the views? :P The weather was nice for this event. The ship itself looked okay too.When it comes to rating cruises of ANY kind, I consider the food and drink qualities, and on-board pricing. Unfortunately, my low rating is the result of that. We didn't eat dinner prior to boarding, so we decided to eat here. We paid $9 for Chicken Fingers with Fries from their limited menu. For a price that high, we expected the food to be really good. While it was edible, the quality was disappointing. The chicken itself was okay (wasn't sure if this was frozen before), but the fries were not fresh, as they were soggy and re-heated. No other sides were included.If that wasn't insulting enough, how about the drinks? $3 for a CUP of soda (which I got). WOW, I've been on other cruises before, and they give you more (a can) for the same price. Oh and if you wanted water, you had to pay $3 for that too (a cup!). On other cruises, it was available at no extra charge (excluding bottles). Want beer or a mixed drink? $9 and more! Yeah, I paid less for all of that stuff (or received more for same price) when I was on another cruise line last month. So yeah, didn't buy any alcoholic drinks for that reason. This was my first (and LAST) time with World Yacht.

Our waiter never asked if we wanted another drink - we had to flag someone down to ask for another glass of wine. \u00a0 After that glass, we again were not offered. \u00a0Dinner service was slower than usual, which is fine because we're on a boat, and I would expect that dinner would last the entire cruise. \u00a0What really disappointed me though was that the DJ started playing really loud music right after we finished our salads - making any table conversation impossible. \u00a0This was not a \"club\" boat, and my expectations were that we would be able to have a nice conversation and catch up with my mom. \u00a0The pounding music lasted for the last two hours of the cruise, so we're basically eating our meal in silence, and every once and a while trying to gesture something or other. \u00a0 If I had known the music was going to be so loud, I would not have booked this ship. I'm in my thirties, so loud music, when appropriate and I'm expecting it, doesn't bother me, but for a \"dinner cruise\", I would expect to actually be able to enjoy dinner and the company of my companions. \u00a0Had service been a little faster (both food and drinks), we may have been able to escape to the upper deck so that we could talk. \u00a0But, it didn't work out. \u00a0The other thing that made me absolutely miserable is that the ship was freezing. \u00a0It was nice to sit by the window, but the draft was terrible. \u00a0When I finally did go upstairs for a few minutes while the bill was being paid, I realized that the heat wasn't on throughout the ship. \u00a0Somewhat minor point, but you combine loud music, slow food and drink service and being cold, it was just miserable. \u00a0I'm not a complainer, but this experience was torture. \u00a0I couldn't wait to get off the ship."}, {"date": "2/17/2013", "star": 2.0, "review": "This review is for the Valentines dinner cruise we went on February 16th, 2013.Let me start off by saying that I have been on this cruise a few times in the past. \u00a0On this particular night they were all setup with a Valentines theme. \u00a0There was a private party on the top floor so all of the Valentines couples were restricted to the lower level.We were seated in the rear of the boat by the bar. \u00a0Strike one. \u00a0If you plan on booking dinner reservations on this boat, make sure you request to sit away from the bar, or upgrade to a window seat. \u00a0Very typical NY seating, basically you are on top of the table next to you. \u00a0Don't expect anything spacious or private.Our server's name was Margarita. \u00a0She was ok. \u00a0Not too swift with the english language, but she had a bubbly personality. \u00a0She did however look swamped with too many tables, and on more then one occasion took forever with our overpriced drinks. \u00a0Be prepared to pay about $15 for a watered down mixed drink and almost $9 for a beer.This is a set menu except for your entree. \u00a0Amuse Bouche - We started our meal off with smoked salmon tartar with cucumber and citrus. \u00a0It was actually very pleasant. \u00a0Had a nice smoked flavor. \u00a0Appetizer - \u00a0The souffl\u00e9 of corn with smoked oysters was pretty bad. \u00a0It had the consistency of a dunkin donuts corn muffin with some chewy oyster pills stuffed in there. \u00a0The bacon bits and sour cream on top didn't really help it out that much.Entree - Me and my girlfriend both had the hand cut Filet Mignon. \u00a0It was cooked to perfection in a cabernet demi glace sauce with a potato puree. \u00a0This was the best thing on our menu. \u00a0It wasn't the best steak I ever had by no means, but it was decent compared to everything else we ate. \u00a0The string bean were still a little frozen, so we just kind of skipped those.Dessert - The warm chocolate ganache cake was nice and warm with a gooey cr\u00e9me anglaise in the middle, topped with some cold whipped cream. \u00a0Mine was cooked to perfection, but my date's was overcooked and crumby. \u00a0After you go around the statue of liberty the DJ tries to pick up the music from elevator to top 40. \u00a0I have been around many good DJ's and this guy isn't one of them. \u00a0He was blending dance records with slow records with records that just didn't make sense. \u00a0People would dance, then sit down, then get up and groups, then cha cha slide, it was rather ridiculous. \u00a0I must say the DJ was a major downer, and I feel they should invest a couple of more bucks into somebody decent. \u00a0Overall, I would not recommend this dinner cruise to anyone. \u00a0As I mentioned before, I have been on this boat a few times. \u00a0None of those times really stand out to me. \u00a0This time it did stand out but not in a good way. \u00a0Do yourself and go to a good restaurant instead, followed by a good NY lounge. \u00a0This way you will be guaranteed good food, music, and dancing. \u00a0The only thing your basically paying for on that cruise is the view and boat fuel. \u00a0Skip it."}, {"date": "2/4/2013", "star": 5.0, "review": "I had a blast cruising around the Statue of Liberty in this boat!The ship was reserved for my group and we got to spend the entire evening dining and partying on the ship.

What better way to see the skyline and get up close and personal with Lady Liberty than cruising the Hudson while sipping mimosas!Food: \u00a0The brunch package includes all-you-can-eat and one beverage. \u00a0The food was buffet style, with a mix of breakfast and lunch food items (from baked goods, fresh fruit and salads, to breakfast dishes, lunch dishes and desserts). \u00a0The food wasn't spectacular, but none of us had anything negative to say about it. \u00a0 Atmosphere: \u00a0Best part for me was the music - having a piano playing gently in the background while getting breakfast is always a welcome change. \u00a0Worst part, the linty cloth napkins on my black dress pants.The overall atmosphere on the boat was nice - the dress code was business casual and the waiters were very nice and polite. \u00a0The boat, as to be expected, was filled with tourists and their families.Was it worth the price...? I probably won't do it again. It was fun, but if I have friends in town I would probably do brunch somewhere in the city and do a sightseeing cruise separately.Also to note, the cruise doesn't go around Manhattan - just from Pier 81 to the Statue of Liberty and turn back, so you don't get to see the full downtown Manhattan 'cruise' experience."}, {"date": "9/3/2012", "star": 1.0, "review": "The boat is average. Not much to expect but not bad either.But I do have a question about the service that night:Each of us (from my table) were charged a $20 services fee addition to the 18% tip and the servant made us to put them (services fee and tip) all in the \"tip\" section (So looks like we tip them more than 50%!!!!). Since I didn't see this $20 service fee policy on the menu I am just curious if this is some trick that they play with all customers."}, {"date": "8/17/2012", "star": 4.0, "review": "My mother had done the dinner cruise with friends back in 2005 for a milestone birthday celebration and really enjoyed it. \u00a0At the time I was still quite young, but the pictures she brought back of the moonlit water, the women in sparkling dresses, and her descriptions of the sumptuous food made a lasting impact on me. \u00a0Fast forward seven years -- now I'm about to turn eighteen, a milestone of my own, and as a gift my father has generously invited me for a dinner out on the boat.The evening was paced beautifully; we arrived at 6:00 for our tickets, but remained on the pier taking pictures and enjoying the evening until about 6:30. \u00a0Once we boarded, we were seated immediately in the lower dining area (there are two) and our orders taken. \u00a0What's nice is that you can leave your table at any time to explore the boat or go up on deck (on the topmost deck they have a little lounge area and a bar for cocktails) and the waiters will refrain from bringing your next course until you are seated again. \u00a0In this way the pacing is set by the diners; we saw some people who had finished their meal in its entirety within the first hour and a half, and others who were still enjoying dessert as we approached the pier.In regards to the food -- it was very good. \u00a0We were brought complimentary bread to start, a choice of multigrain or white rolls (I chose multigrain, my father went with white) and fresh whipped butter. \u00a0Our amuse bouche came next, a buttered crostini topped with a thin spread of gorgonzola and a ripe peach slice. \u00a0The salty bite of the cheese contrasted well with the sweet tang of the fruit. \u00a0For an appetizer, I had the salmon cured with soy and fresh ginger, served over arugula with creme fraiche. \u00a0The salmon portion was generous and of good quality, and though it was a bit on the salty side it was lovely together with the greens and creme fraiche.My entree was pan-roasted duck breast with a saffron risotto cake, blackberry beurre rouge, and sauteed broccoli rabe. \u00a0My duck was cooked well (perhaps a little overdone for some tastes, but I was fine with it) with just enough delicious duck fat, but the blackberry beurre rouge was just divine and I could have done with a gravy boat full of it. \u00a0The risotto cake was the meal's low point -- it was a tad dry, not creamy as I had imagined, and tasted to me a bit like 'ready-rice' to tell the truth. \u00a0The broccoli rabe was cooked al dente and was buttery and delicious, just how I like my greens. \u00a0For dessert I chose the chocolate ganache cake with a raspberry sauce. \u00a0The cake was a standard chocolate 'lava-style' cake, done well. \u00a0The cake to ganache ratio was about 30:70, which was just fine by me, as I am an insatiable chocoholic. \u00a0The raspberry sauce was a tad watery and I could have taken or left it, but the whipped cream on the side was light and went well with the rich cake.I must say, though, part of what made the evening was the gorgeous weather we experienced. \u00a0Though it cooled off a bit once the sun went down, the temperature was perfect, the water was calm and the sky was crystal-clear. \u00a0The views of the Manhattan skyline at night were breathtaking.The bottom line: if you're looking for the best of New York's fine dining, you may be disappointed. \u00a0But if you come with an open mind, relax, and allow yourself to enjoy the evening - and the views from the top deck - the cruise can be a wonderful experience."}, {"date": "7/21/2012", "star": 4.0, "review": "I had a great experience with World Yacht Cruises. We went to the 3 hour dinner cruise. I contemplated purchasing the guaranteed window seats but decided against it at an additional $40pp. We were lucky that we ended up getting a window seat anyway, I guess due to the fact that they were not sold out on our cruise. The staff were excellent, everyone was absolutely nice, accommodating, and friendly! The ship itself is a little dated but still nice and clean. We sat in the corner of the dinning room and had a private table for two.The ship left promptly at 7pm, prior to sailing we were served drinks, bread, and a special appetizer from the chef. As the ship sailed we got our main appetizer, entree, and dessert. All of which were delicious! My husband opted for the jumbo strip appetizer and filet mignon entree which were at additional $10 each but worth it. I order the crab cake appetizer and duck entree which was pretty good. \u00a0I had pre arranged for a cake to be delivered to our table for his birthday. The waiters brought it out at the right time and totally surprised him and even sang happy birthday!! We opted to take the cake home so we can finish the dessert offered. They announced as the ship approached the statue of liberty, so everyone can go up and catch a view outside. At the dining room, the DJ announced all the birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasions on the out loud. They played great music and the dance floor was filled and entertaining. Overall, I would recommend this experience for a special occasion. It is a chance to catch some great views of the city and enjoy a great meal at the same time.

On the plus side, it was a BEAUTIFUL day out and really nice just to be on the water, and we were there with good company.

We were fortunate enough to get a table by the window, but there are wall to wall windows, so you can see the views of the skyline and the statue from any table. \u00a0The stairs leading to/from the upper/outside deck are a bit steep, but the staff was readily available-- and proactive-- about assisting people who looked as if they might require \u00a0a hand to steady them. \u00a0 There is live piano music, which made the atmosphere feel more formal than it actually was. \u00a0I will say that I was disappointed that the dress code was not adhered to, nor enforced by the staff. \u00a0Some parties were dressed in appropriate brunch attire, some were in ratty jeans and t-shirts. \u00a0I would have liked it if there was a uniform application of the expectation, but, hey, I'm kind of old school when it comes to that sort of thing. \u00a0The wait staff was attentive and polite, always refilling coffee/waters and asking if you would like another drink \u00a0(one drink choice is included besides coffee/tea/water-- you can choose from several types of juice, soda, or a mimosa; \u00a0Your refills, additional drinks, and any liquor or wine that you decide to drink are extra, and billed to you at the completion of your meal. \u00a0The meal is buffet style, and there is a separate buffet set up on each of the dining levels (there are two dining levels). \u00a0The breakfast bar included fruit, bagels, toast, eggs, muffins/pastries, sausage, bacon, and waffles. \u00a0The lunch options included garden and caesar salads, green beans, stuffed chicken breast, and fish. \u00a0Dessert was brownies, mini cheesecakes, bread pudding, and a chilled oreo cookie topped chocolate pudding. \u00a0It is all you can eat, and every time I walked past the buffet, the staff was refilling/tending to it, so people were able to eat as much as they wanted to, for the entire 2.5 hour trip, if they chose to. \u00a0 The temperature of the food was maintained appropriately, and the taste was, for the most part, typical of buffet style meals, which is to say from my own opinion, a bit bland, so as to appeal to the broadest amount of palates. \u00a0Several parties celebrated birthdays and special events and the (singing) staff brought cake to their tables (this costs extra). \u00a0 I'm not big the waitstaff singing \"happy birthday\", but it was as tasteful as possible. \u00a0Food service began right after boarding, and people wasted no time lining up. \u00a0There appeared to be very little organization to the line, and the staff was not directing it, so we just waited until the majority of the other people had filled their plates before going up for our own food. \u00a0The restrooms were clean, and the tile work was gorgeous. \u00a0The dining decks are completely contained, so you don't have to worry about being out in the cold/sun/rain/whatever during your meal. \u00a0The upper deck is open with several seating areas. \u00a0The captain slows down when you approach the Statue of Liberty, and there is ample time to get photos. \u00a0Also, a staff member circulates and offers to take your photo for a fee (I believe it was $40 for 4 photos). \u00a0The views of the NYC skyline are breathtaking. \u00a0There were very few children on board, and none in high chairs. \u00a0A 2.5 hour meal/cruise in a contained area is asking a lot of young children, though, and I certainly wouldn't have wanted to bring my toddler along for this outing. \u00a0Little one's who get antsy will detract from your experience, and certainly, the dining experience of others. It's a big boat, but it's really a floating restaurant, plus there's the safety concerns of being on a boat. \u00a0Your kid can't run around freely, so you'll want to keep that in mind if you're ready to book this with kids in tow. \u00a0We enjoyed ourselves, and received good service. \u00a0 I'm not sure I'd want to do it again the next time we're in town, but it was a nice, relatively short, excursion to do once, or once in a while."}, {"date": "4/2/2012", "star": 1.0, "review": "Way too expensive for value.

If I could give them 0 stars I WOULD! Back in August I was celebrating my first wedding anniversary, and my husband and I had been saving up for some time so we could do something nice. My husband was unemployed at the time, and myself, an artist, I don't make much money. My husband and I could only afford their brunch cruise (the cheapest one they have), but a moment after we had made the reservation we noticed we made it for the day AFTER our anniversary, as the Saturday of our anniversary did NOT serve brunch. Silly mistake, so within 2 minutes of making the reservation we called but they're calling center was closed. We left a message AND sent out an e-mail saying we wouldn't be coming for our brunch, we made an honest mistake, please help us change the date. Finally on Monday I was able to talk with a rep who said they couldn't help unless we paid another $40 in fees for the change. WTF, it's not like you went out and bought caviar on our behalf, we LITERALLY called 2 min after purchase and said we WONT be there. $40 is well worth a week of groceries, and we literally couldn't afford to pay a fee. After all at the time we lived paycheck to paycheck, or in this case commission to commission (crossing our fingers they would keep coming). Frustrated, my husband called back and the rep suggested to us to tell our bank it was FRAUD. Yes, FRAUD. He said that is how we would get our money back. My husband, 22 at the time, didn't think about the consequences and followed the rep's \"advice\". Of course this slapped us back in the face, as the company had records of the whole thing. We were recharged the $124 and now stuck. At this point I got in contact with a man named Steve, the accountant for World Yacht. I have to say this guy is really patient and he did go out of his way for me. Probably the only good thing about the company. He tried to work to get my fee down from $40 to $20 as a courtesy and I believe to cover the mistake of a dumb rep, but by the time he got the OK, it was the weekend of Halloween. I was going to be out of town that weekend, I had already bought the tickets, booked the hotel, etc, but Steve informed me that it was the LAST DAY World Yacht would be sailing FOR THE YEAR. I literally had to screw over my family and friends and my visit or pay and extra $20 for a service I had already paid for. I chose family.Fast forward to 2011 \u00a0and the saga continues. It was warm outside so I decided they might be open, and time to make my calls again. I spoke with Steve again who was willing to help, but reluctant because of the time (Sorry I waited so long to call you, YOU WERE CLOSED FOR MONTHS!! my bad!). He told me to call a Ms. Campbell who was extremely RUDE with me. I was speaking to her all nice, and you could just hear her tone of voice slowly escalate, I was just thinking the whole time \"What's her problem? I'm obviously not giving her attitude, I'm calling for help!\". Eventually my tone changed due to her nasty way of treating me, and we literally got NO WHERE. She told me she wouldn't be able to help me at all, even if I paid my fee because too much time passed. WTF! Your policy says that I have to pay a fee for changes, there is NO MENTION of a time frame. BS LADY, BS!!! She ended the conversation telling me to deal with my bank about it, which I told her I've already done 2 claims, the first one being fraud, suggested by one of YOUR employees. This lady literally had no remorse for me, no patience (as she was hostile after her first sentence on the phone...even though we never spoke before) or a sense of customer service. She told me she had to go because she had other customers waiting. BS, you have an answering service, unless of course you're getting THAT MANY COMPLAINTS that you need to take care of.

This appetizer was on the small side and did not come with any sort of sauce, but the dumplings themselves were very good and I would order them again. For my main, I got the \"Colossal Crab Curry Noodle\", which I enjoyed very much. The crab tasted fresh and the curry sauce was very rich flavor with a good balance of ginger, curry, coconut milk, and spice. One friend got the branzino, which was pan seared and served with a light broth, but also quite small in size. Another got the prawn pad Thai, which came topped with 2 huge shrimps still in their shells. Overall, I really enjoyed dining at The Nuaa, although the price is fairly steep for Thai food ($25-35 for an entree) and there are some pretty great hole-in-the-wall places out there."}, {"date": "12/12/2017", "star": 4.0, "review": "A friend of mine who has an excellent knowledge of far eastern cuisine suggested we meet for dinner here. I was looking forward to the evening and when I arrived noticed all the awards and recommendations in the window. The lady was really friendly and straightaway asked if I would like to sit at the table or wait on the sofa, I liked that none of this drink from the bar or you can only sit when all parties have arrived. We ordered the son in law eggs, the name amused me and I enjoyed the egg part though the brioche base was too buttery for my liking. The chicken satay was good and the best starter was the blossom. Soft on the outside crunchy on the inside. Then we had Tom Yum soup, this was superbly presented, three shrimps in a bowl and then the soup poured on top. My friend wanted his spicy, I wanted mine mild and we were both happy. For the main course his colossal crab looked impressive and I had the red fish curry pot which was spicy without being overwhelming. Dessert to cleanse our palates was a scoop of gelato each, I enjoyed pistachio and my friend enjoyed his vanilla. To accompany the meal tried the Thai style iced coffee, asked for minimal ice and the flavor complemented the meal perfectly.

The appetizer and desert were definitely on the smaller size but the presentation and quality of the ingredients justify it. The green curry was in a large bowl but the game hen seemed a bit small.Experience: The interior is beautifully decorated. It is also pretty quiet so it's a great date location. Waitress was quick and responsive and food came out at a reasonable pace.Taste: The appetizer looks beautiful and had a nicely seasoned filling. The taste was good, not amazing, but you can see the care they put into crafting the flower shapes. The cornish game hen was tender and lightly seasoned. The veggies were a good touch but the flavor overall didn't blow me away. The curry alone justifies the 5 stars in my opinion. So rich and just the right amount of spice. We ordered extra rice just so we can finish up the curry! The dessert cream puff was not overly sweet. It was a mild filling that paired with the berry puree to create a perfect combination.

Maybe three more tables. The food took FOREVER to come out considering how empty the place was. We ordered the purple flower dumplings to start. Took about 15 min to come out. Tasted good but nothing spectacular. It's four pieces of bite sized dumplings so we finished it in less than 5 min. Then we waited another 15-20 min for our entrees. The table in front of us and ourselves asked the waiter where our food was and he replied that it was on it's way out but it still took 15 min from when he told us.

The must have appetizers are the purple blossom dumplings which was only served to Thai royalty, made with chicken and peanuts. These treasures are bite size so I could have eaten them all night! The son-in-law quail eggs & brioche was another bite size surprise. The roasted duck buns were another great pick. For the vegetarians try the crispy celery root wild mushroom rolls. I had the pad Thai jumbo tiger prawns so yummy and not heavy. Other entrees to get was the NY strip steak special with a coconut milk and lemon grass sauce you could just eat over rice all day and sauteed ginger with vegetables for the vegans which smelled so fresh and delicious. The side of roasted brussels sprouts was unbelievable and went well with the steak. All of this superb food courtesy of Chef Pitipong Bowornneeranart. Dessert was a must and it changes. I had the Eton Mess which was so goregus to look at yet better eaten - it was Thai sweet basil, strawberry compote, was meringue, whipped yogurt cream and strawberry sorbet by Pastry Chef Anthony \u00a0Lu.

Admittedly I had first heard about this restaurant online as there are quite many places in NYC that people seem to rave about. \u00a0The decor is very fancy with intricate designs for the lighting and walls. The dining area is spacious with an elegant feel to it. \u00a0There is a nice sized bar as you enter the establishment. I was greeted immediately and seated very promptly. It was somewhat late when I arrived but everything on the menu was available. Due to time constraints I was only able to order and eat a a limited amount of food. The appetizers included Coconut Galangal Soup, Son-in-law quail egg and the ever popular Purple Blossom Dumplings. For the main course I chose slow braised short ribs in massaman curry. For dessert there was a separate menu. I chose the black currant cream puff. The presentation of each dish was so elegant and professional. The soup is brought out to you but the broth is separate from the sea bass and other components. They pour the broth over the sea bass in front of you which I had never seen in any other restaurant. Very tasty. \u00a0The quail eggs are served on a brioche with black pepper, shallots and plum sugar tamarind sauce. They come in a set of four which is normally good for sharing and help together by a wooden toothpick. Everything is meant to eaten in one bite. This appetizer certainly did not disappoint. The dumplings came out the same time as the quail eggs. These were certainly special and after seeing them in person understand why they were once only reserved for Thai royalty. The detail is amazing. The purple color and design made this appetizer look like a work of art. \u00a0And the server was good enough to explain to me how each batch is made to order. Which each bite, the peanuts could be tasted. The braised ribs literally slid off the bone. It had been some time since I had any type of Indian curry. This was a great combination of flavors. The server indicated to me that I made a good choice for the entree. The dessert menu had a few items that seem to be specials or seasonal items. The cream puff sounded interesting and when it arrived at the table it reconfirmed why The Nuaa is a very top rated restaurant. \u00a0Apart from the food, the staff made the experience an excellent one. I was helped by different employees and for the most part each one was polite and checked on me. Each dish was brought out in a timely manner with a verbal description of what it was. They recommended dishes and welcomed me to return anytime to try the other popular menu offerings. This place is worth multiple visits.

It was so good that we had to be hyper critical to find anything not to like. It was awesome. The presentation was flawless and beautiful as you can see from the photos. We tried so many dishes that I won't list them all. Some that stood out for comment: The Brussels sprouts were very tasty and, crunchy, mildly sweet, and almost nutty. So good! The purple, star appetizers had great flavor and excellent contrast. Coarsely ground peanuts on the inside and soft semi-sweet covering on the outside. Subtly good and looked great. The pork Penang was good and very tender and the presentation was marvelous. It was a tower of pork leg covered in Penang sauce. However, to nitpick it the pork had no flavor on its own and should have been partially cooked in the sauce as well. According to the secret critic who knows Thai food well the whole meal only gets an 8 out of 10 for authenticity.

Whenever I get something that's slathered in sauce or butter, I feel like they're hiding something. The bad:- TO ADDRESS MY ABOVE POINT: honestly the lobster rolls needed more seasoning. The bread def needed to be toasted with more butter, and the lobster itself actually could've benefited from more mayo/butter/and salt. While I appreciated the presentation of the lobster in such a simple way, it would have been way more delicious if the roll was more flavorful. - The mac and cheese was tiny oh my god when it came out I actually just looked at it in shock. The $$$$$: - Ok, you're in FiDi, you want a lobster roll and therefore you definitely know you're gonna drop some $$ on this meal. HOWEVER $17 for a lobster roll?? Oh my goodness and IT DOESN'T EVEN COME WITH ANYTHING?? Also if you had $17 to blow on a meal, I would recommend so many other places before eating a lobster roll so really only eat here to indulge a very specific lobster craving you should not be having. - The mac and cheese was $15 .... .... .... .... ok if this was a huge mac and cheese with tons of lobster, I'd understand. But if I just ordered the mac and cheese ALONE without the lobster roll and JUST FOR MYSELF, I would honestly be starving afterwards still. Objectively I am not a big person nor do I have a huge appetite, but the portion was so tiny I was literally speechless from shock when it arrived. Basically I'm not gonna come back, unless I have a very specific craving for lobster again. \u00a0NOT BAD, but the portion sizes and eh flavor aren't worth it for the price."}, {"date": "1/22/2018", "star": 4.0, "review": "This is a small location in FiDi with lines that wrap around the entire store. Decor was cute, with a New England beach shack kind of vibe. The lobster roll was delicious, with succulent claw meat left whole, mixed with melted butter, seasoning, and a smattering of mayo. You get a decent serving of meat on their soft buttered split-top roll, but honestly, not enough. Not enough at all.I can probably eat 3 of Luke's lobster rolls before considering myself satiated. But a lobster roll and chips already cost $20, so I'm going with one for now. I wouldn't come here for anything else either. Forget the crab or shrimp rolls.

Luke's Lobster is one of these enterprises, having been founded by a Maine native who, after moving to New York for an investment banking gig, lamented the lack of quality, authentic lobster rolls.At this FiDi venue just steps away from the stock exchange and major financial firms, you'll find rustic, down-home Maine decor. Service is at a walk-up counter, and you'll have your order announced when it's ready. The rolls might look spendy and petite on the surface, but they're jammed with quite reasonable portions. No imitation meats whatsoever here - you're getting the real thing, with the actual sources listed on the walls. At $19 for a trio of half-rolls (lobster, crab, and shrimp), I found things to be reasonably priced given their freshness and tastiness.There are also heartier dishes like bread bowls full of chowder or bisque, and even entrees like lobster mac and cheese. Calorie counts are listed prominently. Throughout the venue, the ties to Maine are quite clear, including a \"lobster ladies of Maine\" calendar that's quite tasteful, is hardly pinup in nature, and supports the Maine fishing and lobster industry.

WHAT?!? where is the logic in this??? we're not stealing from you, we had already paid and YOU were the one who said to fill the cup to the top. so in the end they wasted 3 cups just to not use one big cup?

The person who re-did the checks gave us ALL of the items ordered, but \"subtracted\" the dishes from the other check. The tax from all those items were still added onto my tab.

Maybe next time! As for food, their rolls are good but in a smaller portions so multiple little things is probably best. A good option is shumai. They have a large selection of rolls which making deciding hard. I had a friend get the shrimp tempura roll. I don't remember the name of mine but it was similar except it had avocado and eel sauce on top which sold me!!! Another option was their lunch special that comes with miso soup.

WE DID NOT even FINISH EATING! We asked numerous times to be left alone to enjoy our meal to no avail. The people just kept coming and coming, and looking at our plates, grabbing anything they could get to take off the table - no exaggeration - every 45 seconds someone needed to open the door. They ruined our dinner completely! They just want you to come in, eat and get the f out. The worst possible experience I have ever had a chance to live through eating out. In the end, the manager barged in and was extremely rude saying you need to go, people wait outside - I said I wasn't aware of the time limit and we were trying to enjoy our meal without any interruptions - she said the room isn't just for us and we can't be sitting here as long as we want. I said we've been here less than 50 minutes. She kept waiving her hands in our face (she was standing at the door grabbing things off the table, we were sitting down) I said that they ruined our experience and if that's the case we won't be coming back.

Once I found them I picked up a few items to sample and my family all loved the carrot cake cupcake and I really liked the chocolate cup cake but my kids didn't like it as much. \u00a0I called and spoke to someone a few days before the event and discussed my needs and she made some suggestions for my party and the price per person came out to about 3.00 per person although ultimatly the platters were on the small side and if we had bigger dessert eaters we would not have had enough.I might give them 5 stars but when I called to place the order I was told that I could pick up my order before they closed on Friday at 1:30. \u00a0I said that I worked at Columbia until 1:00 and would could straight from there. \u00a0She said that I would have to come directly and repeated that they close at 1:30. \u00a0On Friday moring I called them at 10:45 to make sure that my order had been made and I was told that they were finishing it up and it would be ready in about 30 minutes. \u00a0I confirmed that they were open until 1:30 and she said that last pick up was at 12:30! \u00a0I asked when they lock the doors and she said 1:00. \u00a0I was able to call my mother and she got in a cab and got over there to pick it up but all I could think of was what if I had shown up at 1:15 to find the store closed and my platters locked inside? \u00a0Not to mention that I placed the order on Tuesday for Friday pick up and they were not ready until 11:15 and had to be picked up by 12:30 - not much of a window for most people. \u00a0In the end it all worked out and perhaps they would have called me if I had not shown up by 12:30 (I like to think they would have) but that error in communication does color my opinion of this place.Over all though I would use them again and I do recommened them if you need non dairy or kosher baked desserts. \u00a0Really yummy and good variety."}, {"date": "9/1/2016", "star": 4.0, "review": "I have purchased cakes from SSSIWC for a few years now, usually a few different loaf cakes when I am having a larger group of company for dinner.

Tasty and familiar and a pretty good deal at $8.95.2) Clams in black bean sauce. Pretty decent portion and tasty! Beware the hot green peppers though.3) E noodles (don't really know what they're called..) but they're thick noodles tossed with shiitake mushrooms and loads of scallions. We got this with seafood which was mostly some squid, one scallop, and a few shrimp. Mild in flavor. It's okay but could've used more seafood.4) Jellyfish in a reddish sauce with bamboo shoots, cauliflower, and peppers. I actually preferred this sauce to the lychee pork one because it was more on the savory side but a bit oily.5) Wild grass shoots (sort of looks like bamboo) with pork. My favorite out of all our dishes! A pretty light dish and a little garlicky.

I've been reserving this spot for some time now. Merry Christmas to The Monro Pub, enjoy!***Let me preface this review by saying this: I've been to a lot of bars. A lot of bars in both Park Slope and in South Slope bars to be precise. What is my point you ask? My point is this: They're all the same. Same lousy bartenders who really want to be anywhere but there, same disgusting tiny bathrooms, same creepishly dimly lit interiors... Who needs that?Not I.The Monro is different. It's a goddamn pub. There are no frills*. It's cozy, it's comfy**. Go there twice and you'll never be forgotten. Because that's how the bartenders are there. They don't forget you. Bring a date. Get cozy & listen to Vinny or Charlie's ridiculous accents that you can barely understand. Laugh, embrace it. Look to your right, look to your left... I guarantee if you spend a little time and open up you'll leave there with a few more friends than you came with. I know I have.You can choose to admire or ignore the taxidermy adorning the walls, but I find them particularly charming depending on the holiday. Especially creepy during Halloween, festive during Christmas season, and lovey dovey during the month of February. \u00a0Whatever you do though - do not forget to make a trip to the bathroom. Seriously, this bar touts the finest looking/smelling & cleanliest bathrooms in all of NYC bars. Show up on a Saturday or Sunday morning when Liverpool is playing. Order a coffee (or a beer) either way you won't be judged. Just don't cheer for the wrong side or you may have to answer to the loyal Liverpool fans who just crawled out of bed, un-showered and unkempt, just to support their beloved Reds.Show up on a Tuesday with a group of your brightest friends and secure a booth early...because the trivia there is not only fun & challenging, but extremely popular among the Park Slope crowd. I've basically withdrawn myself from Tuesday nights entirely because I do not enjoy the feelings of inadequacy I have after securing the minimum amount of points possible round after round.The crowd is eclectic to say the least. But I've come to find that the better bars along 5th Avenue tend to go along those lines. I appreciate the different age groups melding together and getting along over a pint or two. It definitely gives the place more of a neighborhood feel. You never feel out of place there (compared to the hipster spots nearby). The draught beer is your everyday Euro selection, for the most part***. Weihenstephan, Blackthorn (cider), Guinness, Boddingtons, Belhaven, etc.. Honestly, I prefer their bottled selection \u00a0instead. They rotate special selections quite often and I've learned to appreciate that. The well-crafted cocktails are pretty delicious too - and the pours are always generous.---*Unless you count that sweet pinball machine in the back of the bar. Oh, and the numerous board games stacked up near the jukebox. Or the fact that you get a sweet game of Cards Against Humanity going on any given night.**That may change a bit when they finally open up that sweet backyard.***Thank God they have finally added some good 'Murican beers to their selection.

The other manager swooped in, and instead of de-escalating, joined in the yelling and threatening. Needless to say, their appalling behavior put a momentary damper on our party, and we got the hell out of there.

There are some AYCD brunch spots (Carroll Place above all else) where the mimosas come with just a splash of orange juice. Here, they came with less than a splash of champagne. Similarly, the bloodys were mostly tomato juice and I felt like we came away from the meal very full and very sober.I'd give the food in general 3.5 stars (the purgatoria was a smidge above decent), the atmosphere and service maybe 4, but the AYCD deal gets no more than 2, if I'm being generous.You should absolutely not make this a destination of yours and only come if you're in the area.

Then, this place was hopping on a weekend morning, with wait times as long as one hour. However, Good Day managed to meet my expectations with decent dim sum and reliable service (though if you're looking for excellent dim sum I would suggest you trek out further to Flushing, Queens). If it's one of those lazy weekends and you're looking to stay local, Good Day will be your best option. I came in around 9:30am Sunday morning and was seated immediately. There were one or two carts rolling around but a new wave of fresh dim sum is brought out around 10am. Some notes I made about a couple of dishes we ordered: -They make some bomb cheong fun (rice noodle rolls), slippery and well-seasoned with generous fillings of shrimp or beef (or my personal favorite, cilantro+scallion). -An order of steamed fish balls comes with four balls instead of three. More importantly, the texture was just right, hitting that bouncy elasticity without being too rubbery. Good, robust fish taste-- you can tell they didn't skimp on the ingredients and try to cut the fish with lots of corn starch. -The heat from the ginger and jalapenos in the ngau paak yip (steamed beef tripe) was pleasant and warming. What was not pleasant, however, was the almost-gelatinous sauce that coated the tripe, giving off a slimy finish. -Their har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) are quite good. The wrapper is translucent and sticky enough but not overcooked (but I think they can make it a bit thinner!) and the portion of shrimp in there is very large.

It's a popular restaurant since it's the only one of its kind in the immediate area so definitely make a reservation ahead of time if you don't want to wait or even get denied a table. Decor and service are exactly what you would expect at a Cantonese restaurant. I would say service was nice for the most part but they did rush us at the end since there were people waiting.Our typical spread:Walnut shrimp- A classic. I generally use this dish to gauge a Cantonese restaurant. The one here was fine. Not outstanding but not bad either. Option to pay extra for fried condensed milk, which was exceptional!T-bone steak- Delicious! Meat was tender, sauce wasn't excessively salty and had a slight sourness to it, and the outer edges were slightly crispy.Taro nest- The ingredients that they put in the nest weren't what you would normally see, which I wasn't thrilled about. Usually there's some seafood in the nest but the one we got only had beef and chicken. The nest was very crispy but didn't have much taro flavor.Garlic chicken- A welcome break from the typical crispy skin chicken that we always order. The meat was really moist and the chicken wasn't undercooked. A bit salty though. Note: I recommend ordering the half portion. The whole chicken was humongous and we ended up doggy bagging like half a chicken home for lunch the next day!Stir fry veggies- Our vegetable dish of choice. The veggies were savory and I loved the seafood that they mixed in with it.Complimentary oranges and tong sui at the end of our meal. They did seem to almost forget to give it to us though since they were too busy tending to the increasing number of customers waiting in line so we had to remind them. Also came with black sesame pudding that they typically don't give elsewhere!After tax and tip it ended up being about ~$22 per person. While I was stuffed, I think I've had tastier food for a fraction of the price at other Cantonese restaurants in Brooklyn.

I think some time in-between it undergone change of ownership, but I didn't notice any change in the taste of food. For dim sum, it may not be the best but it certainly does the job. Food is delicious and they offer a decent amount of varieties. The restaurant itself isn't huge for a dim sum place and as they try to get as many people seated as possible, often I find myself elbow to elbow with strangers sitting in the table next to me. During weekend, it is a mad house, so be prepared to wait a little longer or, if you are near the end of the meal, be prepared to be rushed by waitstaff. For dinner, it is better to make a reservation; otherwise, be prepared to wait around 30-45 mins during peak hours. It wasn't used to be the way, but in recent years, I notice there has been an increase in people coming here for dinner. So it might be that. Service is quick and attentive. They are very good at following up your order and making sure everyone at the table has clean plates. Food is fresh, piping hot and delicious. I have tried many different dishes here and I have never been disappointed. Complementary fruit, coconut pudding, and red bean soup are brought out at the end of the meal.

It's an ideal atmosphere to get some serious work done, while pretending you're enjoying a night out. Or vice versa! Drinks at Stumptown and the lobby bar are all expensive, but great quality. The bar has a few cheap canned beers if you want to enjoy the atmosphere on a budget. They also have a happy hour menu. I've been here at various times of day and it seems like the bar is busiest during happy hour, though it's never been packed. A lot of reviews mention that the lobby gets very crowded, but I have always been able to find a seat without much trouble. There are alot of sectional couches and the corner seats tend to be less desirable, so those are open, but you might have to crawl over some folks to get there. Also, beware that power outlets are not easily accessible from many seats. If it is really full, just hang out at the bar until you can snag an armchair.The wait staff are very attentive about taking drink orders (don't have to order at bar first) and keeping the place clean.

We asked a question about when we would be able to pick up our bag when checking in (were given very little direction on gather our 1 suitcase, and waited 15 minutes before asking about if we were even waiting for someone ... which one of the behind the desk guys responded in a \"well yea your going to have to wait, because we are very busy\" and had a serious attitude. Then went to check it out and grabbed us our suitcase. NYC is busy- I imagine the hotel is usually busy but didn't appreciate the lack of hospitality. Our room smelled musty and had some black mold in the corners of the bathroom. Prices for room service is insane but I guess to be expected - my burger and fries, and glass of wine was 60$. But the beds were comfortable and the rest of staff kind. I just feel like they are overwhelmed and overpriced but the area is great and the lounge is awesome with the coffee shop below."}, {"date": "7/17/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "This isn't a review for the hotel since I've never stayed there as a guest.

My ideal really isn't an incidental charge which is half of the price of my entire stay either. That hit me like a ton of bricks when the concierge nonchalantly told me of the charge. I understand this is commonplace at some hotels but while booking my stay I wasn't explicitly told the outrageous amount for \"in case I use the mini bar service\". Very disappointing since now I have to wait for that to drop off my card. The room was ok but too dimly lit to see anything. The large bathroom door was cumbersome and really cut into the room space so it was kept closed the entire stay. There also wasn't any table or space to set anything. The mini bar items took up all of the available flat space so many of my personal item got shoved and stacked in odd places.

So I kept trying to keep my hands in my lap, which wasn't fun. We literally had to shout for the person who changed coals to come over to our table. A staff member told him our table needed service but he was so caught up with speaking to girls in the table RIGHT IN FRONT of us and totally forgot about us.

Once the rice caramelized, we dug in. The seafood was on point and you'd have to travel to Seville to get rice equally as good. For dessert we enjoyed the flan which was perfectly creamy and sweet.

Between 10 people, we split 3 paellas - the squid ink, the all seafood, and the seafood with chorizo, as well as a cheese plate, the lamb leg, and the jamon plate for appetizers. If the name didn't suggest, stick to the paella only. In fact, I'd only order the squid ink paella as the other two paellas didn't compare. The squid ink had so much flavor - you really taste the squid ink. This one had more scallops than the others, which was soft and cooked well. Plenty of seafood in all though, so I complaints on consistency there. The most amazing part though was the crispy rice after the rice sat for awhile. I literally was gauging the spoon into the pan to scrap each and final piece of rice. Skip the appetizers as we literally did not even touch the cheese plate and the jamon platter was the worst cured meats plate I've ever had. The lamb leg was okay.

Let's start with the booze. 16 drafts on rotation won't disappoint. Real fresh cocktails with names like Lindy Hop and essential ingredients such as lavender honey syrup and rhubarb bitters. And the two single malts we wanted... they had.Now food. Grilled cheese with tomato soup, short ribs spring rolls, 35-day dry aged prime beef burger, and herb-roasted bone marrow. Grilled cheese was solid, mix of various cheeses on multi grain with thick slice of tomato. BUT! I wasn't crazy about the tomato soup... I mean, liquid ketchup with a dash of cream. The short rib spring rolls were actually impressive. I went in thinking it would taste like a basic spring roll with no meat nor flavor and then BAM, seasoned soft beef goodness with the very first bite.The fries taste hand cut, though I'm not 100% sure. 2 orders of bone marrow were enjoyed by our group and the burgers hit the spot. Oh! We also ordered mac & cheese. That was the only dish to really disappoint. Liquid cheese, no substance, little flavor, had to use salt and pepper, barely any crust on top. Can't win them all, but all else was great.Service. On point. Our server, she was a rockstar.

I sighed and said, \"Let's get walking, I know a good place near here.\"We stepped up the concrete to a busy hostess walking to and fro between tables and the bar. I half expected a waiter to come up to me and exclaim, \"We got an E for effort!\" on the decor and paired menu. With a home-away-from-home look, the Grange provides a similar ambiance that I imagine the house of a misplaced, homesick Kentucky native might look like. As the tungsten provides a warmer glow to evenings and late nights, the restaurant transforms from a busy, boozy brunch spot in upper Manhattan, to a warmer dinner and bar restaurant. The liveliness is amped by the long hours, with virtually no closing time in sight, since the kitchen is chalked up to be open till 2-3 AM. A sure pioneer, or at least ardent advocate, of a recent business trend - focusing on a dining experience catering to conversation over quality or any other form of focus on the food - the Grange's menu is neither innovative nor the most exciting read of a lifetime. The food is only disappointing if the standards are set too high, which is unfortunately often the case for middle-class NYC young professionals, looking for a night out with friends or a basic brunch. Fortunately, I had no such expectations.As I sat down to a Pork Belly Benedict, the slab bacon was bang on the mediocre line, while the egg and hollandaise straggled in pursuit. As my dad mouthed incomprehensible motivations about life, my mind wandered to the slightly more appetizing grass-fed beef burger I'd ravenously chowed down on. The meat was prepared, I imagined, by someone hoping to get it right on the first attempt, and as the burger stayed in place, I couldn't help but wonder if it hadn't breathed a sigh of relief at not falling apart of its own volition. I turned to the fries with a glimmer of hope as I turned into a transitioning vegetarian, but they couldn't rescue the meal as they'd gone cold, and stared at me in their orderly disarray, aware of the disappointment they'd caused.Conjoined, yet separated by miles, the bar adjacent to the tables is geared towards countryside eatery conversation, while the tables are family, group or pair dining (or the brave solo consumer). Maintaining an equilibrium between groups of graduate students, families, wandering tourists, and clueless strangers, the Grange wholeheartedly accepts New Yorkers for their vast breadth of the middle-class spectrum, and one could be welcomed as warmly in plaid and denim as they would be in cotton and khakis. One could not blame the tourist, the Long Island native, nor the middle-class family venturing warily into Harlem, for recommending the Grange to friends as a reliable brunch and dinner restaurant."}, {"date": "8/10/2017", "star": 3.0, "review": "My boyfriend and I went for a random brunch and it was okay.

Not sure what to say about salad... It had half a sliced avocado on top of a bed of crispy clean lettuce. It came with a dressing on the side. \u00a0The Salmon Tartar was really good. We liked the acid and the salmon itself was light and fresh. There was also a little bit of saltiness from the light soy sauce as well. It was also topped with a quail egg which added creaminess. It had a little bit of every taste, and all unite to form a very pleasing taste. Lastly, the sushi and sashimi set actually had quite the spread. There were several salmon and tuna sushi, some california rolls, and about 12 slices of mixed sashimi, from salmon to tuna to other fish I can't identify. It looked beautiful on the plate, and everything tasted fresh. We loved all the choices.Lastly, the woola roll. As I cannot handle spicy, I asked them to take off the Jalapenos. It was very delicious... it had some crunch, some creaminess, and a little saltiness. I would really recommend it. I really liked the crunchiness, without having to resort to tempura.

The nigiri was very good quality and only $12 for 5 pieces and a California roll. My husband doesn't like miso and tried to substitute a different soup, even offering to pay a surcharge for it, but was denied. That's pretty crummy, in my opinion. However, his two rolls were filling enough (and way more fish than rice, which is a good sign,) so neither of us walked away hungry. They also offer red bean ice cream, which is my favorite. :)"}, {"date": "4/22/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "Great food, not a lot of people on Tuesday evening when i went.

I had absolutely no problem eating most of it, my friend got pissed that we were supposedly \"splitting it\". Whatever, she was talking too much.

I mostly goto this place for a specific order as their chicken, I think, is pretty good. When I've dined here with a friend, I thought it was an OK experience. On this day, I ordered take out, and I think, whoever is the new bartender needs better training in customer service. When I went to pick up my order, I saw an order sitting at the edge of the bar. The old bartender was pretty smart and would place the order behind the bar that she was attending and you would have to flag her attention to get the order. This new bartender I guess places the order on the bar.Regardless, I went to go look at the receipt on the order to see if it was my order. I had no plans on taking the order without informing someone, but the woman sitting at the bar, who I thought was a customer, that was dressed down, accosted me about not taking the order, which I had no plans on doing. I told her I was there to pick up the order and she asked me immediately why I didn't ask her. First off, she should have introduced herself as someone working there and asked me if I needed help, but she did not, so I had no idea she was an employee since she was sitting casually at the bar. She said she accosted me because she wanted to prevent people from stealing the order. Well, again, she could have introduced herself to me by asking if I needed help and not being aggressive and lecturing. You are the servicer and I am the customer. You can't talk to customers that way, especially when I already paid. It's a common best practice in all restaurants to not speak to customers aggressively. I agree with the other reviewers that management needs to be more present here and customer service training needs to be reevaluated. I think putting orders behind the bar like the old bartender did would also be a best practice they should continue."}, {"date": "6/11/2017", "star": 2.0, "review": "I am writing this review, after I have calmed down and decided , it'd be a great story to tell.... so here you go :)Now, I have been to Harlem Bar-B-Q at least 5-6 times. \u00a0Two times were for events and the others just to grab a frozen drink or food. \u00a0Now, their customer service is usually mediocre and I accept that. \u00a0HOWEVER, yesterday took the cake. \u00a0I went to the restaurant around 7pm. I was there with two of my other friends, we came to grab a bite to eat. \u00a0Let me just run down the events:1. \u00a0We decided to sit in the extended part of the bar. \u00a0We had menus (thank you hostess), however we sat for about 12 mins and no one even said \"hi\" or \"I'll be back\". \u00a0The lady, who we eventually learned was supposed to be our waiter, had walked past us at least 3 times within those 12 mins. \u00a0Okay, cool. \u00a0We eventually tell the hostess that we have been waiting and no one has said a word to us. \u00a0Less than a minute letter the young lady walked to our table (we learn later, here name was Ines \u00a0-- hot a** mess). \u00a0She was not the friendliest. But whatever, \u00a0we order food and my friend ordered a virgin pina colada.Fast forward 2. \u00a0It's like 20 mins later and we are wondering what happened to his drink. \u00a0I think at this time we only had water and my friend had a soft drink. \u00a0So I stop Ms. Ines and ask her what happened to the pina colada , at that time she states that the machine was broke or something of that sort. And I asked her, well why didn't you just say that to him. \u00a0(UGH! I'm annoyed with her , but whatever). She never even offered him an alternative and she never refilled our waters or my friend soft drink .The order comes out and it's wrong. My friend wanted collard greens and got coleslaw, it gets sent back to the kitchen for the collards. \u00a0It's like 15 mins in, I'm done eating whatever I plan to eat and my friend is pretty far into his plate, still no collards and no Ines. Oh okay.This young lady, did not ONCE , ask if we needed anything. Let's be very clear about that.So it's about 30 mins and I'm like okay, we need the manager. \u00a0They call the manager ... why is he just as horrible in the customer service department as Ms. Ines . He goes to talk to Ines. And of course now, whatever little customer service she had deep down in her is gone. She comes to the table and says \"he told meTo come over here ..: I nearly died, like heifer --byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. \u00a0Now I'm fired up because not only were we (1) ignored (2) not really waited on at all, and (3) still waiting for collard greens --- now Mr . Manager doesn't even apologize for the poor service. Whaaaaaaa. 3. I realized they are just a mediocre bunch and I'm like --- cool . Get it how you live it. But mmmm... I ask for the owners info or the email to make a complaint. The manager says he'll get it. And he's doing a million and one things and right before we are about to leave he says, he will not give it to us. \u00a0Oh really? So, now I'm making it my business to make sure the owner or managing agent knows about this. I get that we have different customs, but a simple apology and fixing of this could have really changed the entire course of our experience. So my advice, do not expect good customer service. The drinks are usually good. And the food has great portions. But I'm not sure if it's worth it when you have to deal with people who don't want to be there. I would likely only go back for their monthly event. And you, Mr. Manager guy, ha! That's what I got for you ----HA!

The opposite of hole-on-the-wall, the grandest of all.Thai Villa, you will savor flavorful dishes rarely served outside of Thailand! When most people hear \"Thai cuisine,\" they think about Pad Thai, Tom Yum, and other popular street foods.

Thai Villa specializes in sophisticated, little-known cuisine such as Shrang Wa Goong and Kaeng Run Juan , originally prepared for Thai royalty in generations past. They want to introduce a new generation to these classically-prepared dishes and ensure they won't be lost. Thai Villa philosophy is to conserve the Thai royal cuisine and share their love for this wonderful food with guests who are willing to pay for it and those who have the palate to appreciate it.Fried Turmeric Coconut Calamari - Crispy fried Calamari served with Roasted Bell Pepper-Peanut Vinaigrette Dipping Sauce, yum.Soft Shell Crab Papaya Salad is a must try. Steamed Mussel - Mussels, Onion, Long hot pepper, basil leaves in a curry broth.Chicken Panang Curry - Sweet Potatoes, Kaffir Lime Leaves, String Beans with Coconut Milk.Pla Tod Nam Pla - Deep fried fillet of Bronzino served with Young chili Relish and sticky rice, a must order! And my favorite: Mieng Kum - Leaf-wrapped Bite side, Diced Ginger, Lime, Red Onion, Peanuts, Dried-Shrimp, Roasted Coconut Flake served, with Betel Leaves topped with Caramelized palm Sugar sauce... so picture perfect and perfect in every bite!

It took about 10-15 minutes for the food to come out and that made us all happy. I thought the food was just okay. For my entree, I ordered the Nuer Yang and there was nothing really special about the dish. The meat wasn't seasoned much. The spicy tamarind sauce that the dish came with was what saved the entire meal. This sauce was SO good. I had to order an additional portion of the tamarind sauce because it was that satisfying. Sadly, there was only about 10 pieces of meat, more than half of the dish was salad -- didn't know that was what I ordered (since on the menu it is described as filet mignon with sticky rice). I would've ordered a salad if that's what I wanted. My friend who ordered the same dish as me enjoyed it slightly more. She actually didn't like the sauce (and gave it to me) or the salad, so she only ate the filet mignon. We both didn't think it was worth $28 at all. My other friend had the Panang Curry and I thought that dish was delicious. It had a lot of flavor, perfect amount of heat (she ordered it extra spicy and they delivered exactly what she wanted) and it was a reasonable portion. Another friend ordered the Basil Fried Rice with shrimp and she enjoyed her food as well. As a Southeast Asian and someone who's eaten at countless Thai restaurants, I thought this restaurant was over-hyped and definitely not worth the wait. I've been to several other restaurants where I've had much better food, paid a lot less for a meal, and didn't have to wait such a lengthy amount of time. It's actually sad that the amount of time we waited until we were seated was longer than the amount of time we spent eating! If you have to wait any amount of time to dine here, do yourself a favor and find another restaurant. And if you're really adamant about giving them a try, definitely come on a Sunday-Thursday instead because they don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday."}, {"date": "5/21/2018", "star": 2.0, "review": "The Pad Thai was SOOOOOO SPICY.I dont know if it was a mistake or if they just have a very high threshold but my friend and I asked for Mild/Medium spice and the pad thai was so spicy we could barely eat it."}, {"date": "5/21/2018", "star": 4.0, "review": "The decor is beautiful and unique.

Don't dine in here; just don't. The interior is very drab with fluorescent lighting that reminds me of an unfinished basement. We were also there at the same time a freaking HUGE party of about 30 people (including a large handful of kids) was dining. It was some sort of party. It was extremely loud and the parents had no concept of keeping an eye on their children as they ran and screamed around the entire restaurant. Many times, they used our table as a kind of base in their game of tag. So, I will order delivery in the future because I don't ever want to risk competing with such a large crowd. Otherwise, the place was empty at first. We were allowed to choose where we sat, but because we sat near a table for six when a party of at least eight came in, we were asked to move our seats, which was annoying. Restaurants with actual respect for their paying customers wouldn't pull a switcheroo like that, in my opinion.The place could be a lot cleaner. The bottles of sauces (ketchup, yogurt, and something green - jalape\u00f1o, maybe?) all felt really greasy. I also saw a sizable beetle walking across the floor prior to ordering, which needless to say put me off. The potato wedges were wonderful. They were very large and nicely seasoned.I don't remember exactly what I ordered for my dinner, but i know it was beef something with chicken tikka over rice. The menu is so large, and yet so many of the plates are very nearly the same. The chicken was good. The beef was fatty and pretty forgettable. The yogurt sauce, though room temperature, is addictive. That said, I wish the dish came with its own sauce so I didn't have to keep reaching for the condiment bottles. I suppose I was expecting something really saucy, like the stuff from Halal trucks. But I now know that \u00a0just because a place has \"Halal\" in the title, doesn't mean it will be like cart food... The place is also weirdly between wait service and self-service, kind of like a pizzeria. In my opinion, if you are going to have wait service at all, you may as well have the servers provide drinks as well. Having to get our own drinks from the fridge seemed a bit silly. So, if (IF) I ever want to eat this place's food again, which I probably won't, I am getting takeout! I suggest you do the same.

I thought the horror was over once we got our check but then we had explained how we wanted our check divided up and the server said she understood but when we got our receipts she charged us more than what the entire bill was!

I have to say, those warm tortillas with the butter were the highlight of my meal. Delicious!Unfortunately, the rest of my meal did not live up to the positive start.

I started with the Sinigual Salad. This had slices of jimica, greens, tortilla strips, Peoria's, and cotija cheese crumbles. I would come back just for the salad- that good! For others at the table got the Fire Roasted Tomato Soup and it looked pretty good but I heard it packed a kick to it. \u00a0For my entree, I chose the Carnitas Yucat\u00e1n which was pork with avocado hash, cilantro rice, red and black beans, and corn cake. The pork was moist and had great flavor. I really enjoyed the consistency and flavor of the bean combination. The corn cake was mushy and the rice didn't do much for me. For dessert, we shared flan but I'm not a fan of flan in general. Others at the table said the flan was very good with a homemade whipped cream on top.

We tried to get in either Wednesday or Tuesday and they were packed with a long wait list. We then made a reservation to come back on Saturday. We were seated as soon as we got there (no wait time on Saturday night) and our waitress greeted us. She was friendly and got our drink orders and said \"Would you like some guacamole to start?\" We said that would be great - she didn't mention it would be $15. The guacamole was just ok, not fabulous or over the top, or worth $15. They make it right in front of you by your table which I assume is what you are paying for. I noticed other reviews got complimentary tortilla with salsa/butter and we did not get that at all.Drinks: My husband got the mojito and he said it tasted great. I got the Grilled Pineapple Margarita.. or that's what I ordered. Once again, previous reviews showed this drink and what I got and the other pictures did not match. It actually didn't taste anything like the description. I think I was given the wrong drink but the waitress did not come around enough for me to tell her so I just drank the margarita. While sitting there, I noticed every other margarita drink came out with the grilled pineapple on the rim. Mine had a lime. Had I gotten the correct drink, I would have purchased another.Food: As stated above, guacamole is just average. Spare yourself the $15 and get something else. My husband got the fish tacos and I got the chicken fajita. The tacos were ok, nothing special. The fajitas were pretty good. They do not come with normal sides like any other Mexican restaurant. All it comes with is beans, pico and guac. I usually get lettuce cheese and sour cream at every other place I go. I asked for some sour cream and she brought me some - note there was a $2 charge for side of sour cream. That should automatically come with fajitas.Overall, I am giving it 2 stars to be nice.

We were instantly greeted by a food runner with tortillas and sauces. Must say I devoured them tortillas because I love bread *oprah voice* the brown sauce? Was great, just my type. I order the chicken fajitas (came with more bread ayeee) and it was the most succulent thing I've had this year. My other guests, they ordered a shrimp fajitas and a combo platter I believe and it was just amazing. I'm talkin picking off each other's plates, offering each other food like we were raised too well! (We were lol)You get what I'm saying though, the food was good! Drinks? Only one person at our table ordered drinks and she didn't like the (essence of a spicy margarita?) she had and opted for another one she appreciated more. Back to service? When we first sat down it was like the waiter was in a rush to take our orders and was a bit flustered. I'm a server so I know how one thinks when they get sat with a table of young people (oh they won't tip blah blah), but like I said I serve and there's no way I'm going out with friends, the foods this bomb and we aren't tipping at least 18%. Just wouldn't be right. However, he did check on us here and there, and shout out to the food runner for being so friendly to us and helping us out whenever we need our server. Definitely a great date night or girls night if you're craving Mexican cuisine. The lighting is just right and the overall look and feel of this place screams intimate imo.ALSO GET THE PATRON FRIED ICECREAM!

That outdoor sandwich board slays.3) I am a frequent to-go guest. Sometimes this can be experienced as lesser-quality food or a poorly poured drink. Not true for TCC.

Overcooked asparagus4. Julienned red peppers on most of the tapas plates that were completely tasteless, as if they'd been soaked in tap water. Equally unattractive green peas on each plate.5. Loud, super bright, and tightly packed chairs and tables6. Complementary nacho chips for the table, of which some where soft/borderline soggy (yuck!)7.

We realized as soon as we sat down why there weren't many people. The restaurant refused to put on the AC!! Perhaps they don't have one? All the restaurant had was one small fan that did absolutely nothing to how hot it was. Granted this Sunday was probably the HOTTEST day we've had so far but come on guys this is unacceptable. It was evident that everyone, including the staff, \u00a0was uncomfortable and irritated at the heat. The staff was literally fanning themselves while taking orders. People were sweating. I truly don't know how the owner of this place thinks that acceptable. So because of this, the service wasn't very good either as the staff kept much to themselves trying to keep cool.

Who knew that Uzbek food would be so light, so fresh, so \"clean? The \"Greek\" salad has so much finesse that it makes other versions seem clumsy in comparison. The lettuce, tomato and onions are exactly the right size to fit together on your fork. The vegetables are bathed in a delicate olive oil vinaigrette, then topped with a snowdrift of dry feta and hairlike threads of basturma (salt cured, dried beef). Don't miss the samsa, a flaky pastry stuffed with hand-chopped lamb, onions and cumin. In fact, every item on the \"Dough\" section of the menu is delicious. After all that dough, I haven't been able to do justice to the entrees on my two visits to Aziza 7. I can attest that Chicken Tabaka (flattened and cooked under a brick) is outstanding. On my most recent visit, the server recommended the cutlet, but the kitchen was out. The chef proposed lamb with vegetables. What arrived (see the attached picture) was a platter of fork tender chunks in a dill-spiked jus with red and yellow peppers, onions, and home fried potatoes, which picked up the flavor of the lamb.The menu at Aziza 7 is in both English and Russian. Most of the patrons seem to be from the former Soviet Republic, enjoying platters of fish, kebabs, salads, and of course dumplings and savory pies.

The mustard and jam as accompaniments are also crucial and they will keep the bread coming as needed.The happy hour deals here are pretty good, but the generous offering is that it goes until 8pm.

I had some time to kill around the area and was looking for a place to go. Wolf and Deer seemed to have the best wine list out of every place within reasonable walking distance so I chose to go here. When I first walked in, on a Saturday night, it was packed and I thought it was some hipster place... but the crowd thinned out a bit and the vibe changed a bit.The wine list was pretty good... Not quite wine bar standard, but there were some decent options, better than what most bars tend to have. The atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly and not afraid to moderate the situation and cut people off if they are drinking too much, which I appreciate as a woman going out alone.What I really admired looking at though was their cocktail list. There were so many unique creations based on literature, and it was such a fun and unique concept, and reminded me of a library and bar I used to go to in Japan that had a similar theme.I'm not much of a cocktail person at all and prefer to drink wine, but even I was tempted to try one...I will definitely be back, probably for wine, unless I give into the temptation which is their rather impressive seeming cocktail list."}, {"date": "1/16/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "Great service from Kelsey and awesome craft cocktails.

It was a shadowy night in Park Slope Brooklyn. \u00a0The rain glistened quiet on the sidewalk with small specks of gold to Wolf and Deer.Without a sign, and empty with the lights on before 5pm, the bar was unrecognizable in a shelled infancy. \u00a0It almost looked like a banquet room for a neighboring restaurant.5:05pmThree people had now arrived, the lights dim, as a royal blue dusk, and shadows of trees listened to birds over head.The bartender handed me a book. \u00a0I flipped through the pages until I came to \"happy hour\".$6 happy hour red wines came in two varietals. \u00a0I chose montepulciano which came a ruby grape red in a healthy 8 ounce pour, with a balanced taste of sweet fruit and dry, with smoky earth. \u00a0Vines curled around me, blossoming small white flowers that seemed to hum.I turned the page to the Lost Boy Kitchen where Little Red Riding Hood bruschetta, with shrimp, tarragon and marscapone, and three little pigs say macaroni and cheese with a jalape\u00f1o and prosciutto add on option plucked at my heartstrings to be beat by the happy hour charcuterie special of any 3 meats and or cheeses for $12. I didnt have time to read the ample cheese menu, with over 10, but instead focused on meat, and chose wagyu beef, duck and prosciutto. \u00a0 The meat, like the wine was of good quality and a great value in such a large portion. I saw a page full of whiskeys, a page full of beers, and a page full of craft cocktails all affordably priced. A waterfall poured behind me into a crystal pool with dancing gold salamanders on rocks as happy fish swam underneath lily pads. \u00a0The humans multiplied in numbers at this packed small modern yet old world cozy feeling bar.With $9 craft cocktails, $12 charcuterie boards and $6 wines happy hour is not to be missed if you are in Park Slope.I sprouted large strong wings and a gold brick path beckoned before me to another world.And I lived happily ever after."}, {"date": "1/4/2017", "star": 4.0, "review": "Strolling thru the neighborhood,this is def a spot to check out.

Blasphemy. This place is one of my favorite cocktail bars..... when I can get a seat. Alas the only strike against this place is that the place is somewhat on the smaller side. I'd say arrive at the right time, but who knows what the right time is. I've been there at \"dead\" hours and it was packed. Been there for the \"busy\" hours and there were several spots available. Basically, just get lucky. They make do with the space they have. The bars narrow U shape design that enables the staff to operate behind the bar, with a door at the end to exit. There's some space in the front, I'd recommend it if you came with a crew. Though this place isn't a place you come with a crew. What makes the place clutch is that it has a happy hour that goes till 8. We all can't make it to that happy hour that goes till 7. We have to work. You gotta squeeze in the gym. Or you know, stare at your phone for endless hours, escaping the non exist meaning of life..... Oh wait, back to the review. They know how to make drinks here. If you don't like anything on the menu, they'll make you something you like. The design of the bar is beautiful. Their glasses placed above the bar are a nice touch. It goes hand in hand with the wonderful cocktails they make. I wouldn't say this is a place to get dinner, rather it a place to nibble or grab a snack. They have a few dishes which go perfectly with your drinks. And there are beers to have as well, though what's the point of going to a cocktail bar and not getting cocktails.

Please be aware, medium spicy here is very hot. Mild has no spice at all. I am not sure why they can't adjust the spiciness according to the customers request. But anyhow, I still love this place, just the crab rice, liver and gizzards and the sauteed ground pork/chicken.

If you like getting Drunk and ONLY wants to feel the \u00a0heat on your tongue, is the only time you should be at this place, or/ and if you like to just throw your money in the gutter. But if you know what taste is of quality food and service, please look elsewhere.It was Saturday night around 11pm. It was cold and We were hungry!!! Why did I emphasized this particular point, you might ponder on, \u00a0is cuz' usually when famish, everything taste good, theoretical cliche' drawn after centuries' worth observation and experience (this will help me make my point later). We had originally planned to try this new a thai place on Bell Blvd, 101 Thai, which stated on Google their closing time at 11:30pm but flipping their chairs on the tables by 10:39pm, so we decided that without further waste of time \"we should go back to that Thai restaurant that we went to once-upon-a-time (almost 2 yrs ago) and loved it. Once there, the service started as it should so no opportunity to make money should be amissed: sitting was quick and hotess was active in suggestions when asked about spice level of various dishes. We took her words to the heart, so we ordered according to her suggestions. It was CHAOS from this point!!!1. Appetizer and entree were placed in front of us \u00a0within one minute of each other2. Tom yum soup was nothing which is sour liquid. 3, the sour fried curry dish, we had ask for it to be removed from our table because of a horrible distinct taste and smell. And the hostess actually did say sorry because she agreed with us. 4. We had asked for menu again \u00a0which she said she would fetch , but she got busy seating the newcomers \u00a0instead of taking care of her existing \u00a0customer 5.when Jungle Curry WE ordered finally arrived, boy was it another disappointment along tasteless Pad Tai noodles, which tasted like Panda Expresses dried cooked-in-Rush noodles. It could be called authentic Thai if the definition is water + red chilli power + heat = jungle curry, which it is not because as foodies, we (my husband and I) we enjoy good Thai food and know what it should taste like. 6. By this time our appetite was gone and we asked for a check, the hostess who agreed with our disappointment about the hardly-touched-dish and removed it from our table, had the audacity to present \u00a0the bill \u00a0with that dish charged in the total. \u00a0And when paid, Shamelessly, \u00a0kept the change without bringing it back to us.Food and the service is shamelessly bad and embarrassingly to the private businesses.

I recommend the fried watercress salad and the 'curried rice croquettes with preserved pork salad' (anyone can help me pronounce the Thai name? This name sucks.) I also love their soups, and often get the Beef Tendon soup.Be aware that if you say Medium Spicy at this place it is more like Thai Spicy at other places.

Initially, I think our server was a little worried about the spice but when the dishes came, it was perfect for us. The soups were awesome; best Tom Yum I ever had! They were full of mushrooms and the protein of our choice and the broth was thick with lemongrass and ginger. The noodles was terrific as well; full of Chinese broccoli and other veggies as well as saut\u00e9ed tofu. The tofu was saut\u00e9ed differently then others I had seen as they were more firm but still soft, this created a unique and very good texture and taste.

They allow you to choose your own type of noodle (Thin rice noodles, flat noodles...etc.). In my case, I chose it with the thin rice noodles. The broth is a little salty and sweet but flavorful. The duck is a little fatty. This big bowl costs only $9. If you are open to trying new foods/flavors, their Bamboo Shoot Salad is good one to try. If you are used to the wide variety of Asian flavors, you will love that. My Pookie and I also tried the Braised Pork Leg. It took a while to come out. Around 25 minutes? It was too salty for us, and the rice sank into the sauce, so we couldn't finish everything. The sauce tasted similar to the broth used for the Duck Noodle Soup, but more potent. Playground is open until late -- 4AM on most days? They are cash only. I've come here a couple times with my Pookie bear. Very happy each time! It's not good for big groups, but great for one-on-ones with friends or dates. The restaurant is a little dark at night with pop/trap/hip-hop/modern music, making it seem like a club or bar.

Not only is the service on point, the food is authentic and delicious. The mild spice hit the spot and the food portion was filling enough that we had to take home the leftovers for the next day! It was well worth the bill we spent compared to ordering out in a Thai restaurant in the city. There is happy hour about all night and the location is open late night! Super chill bar and great for a group. We ordered tom yum soup and could barely finish the spicy goodness. Their noodle dish was large portioned too for a \u00a0reasonable price. I ordered a ground beef dish of spicy squid which I enjoyed and finished, however it did not come with rice...?! So that was an extra $2 for jasmin rice.

Upon our arrival at 6pm, our amazing waiter, Alex, said that he was able to give us more attention because it wasn't too crowded yet. He patiently walked us through the menu, chatted with us about both Xixa and Traif, and even shared two drink recipes with us - the incredible Midnight in Paris cocktail that we got and a more low-key one that he makes at home. By the end of the meal, I must've gushed about how absolutely incredible it was that this existed 20 times - it's definitely my favorite restaurant now, by far. (Sorry Sugarfish, you've been usurped). It's like Xixa scanned my brain, highlighted everything I love, and presented them to me in exalted forms - foie gras, bone marrow, duck, tea flavored desserts, and passionfruit. The food was extraordinary, and I started daydreaming yesterday of having a wedding reception here because THIS is what I want to celebrate with. All the time. For everything. Alex recommended that we get the Chef's Tasting, and we are so thrilled that we did. $55 for 8 courses + 1 amuse bouche + a complimentary dessert? Sure, why not? By the end of the meal, I was flabbergasted that all this attention to detail, intensive labor, expensive ingredients and sublime taste could only cost so little. It is an unbelievably good deal. + Pickled green bean with cilantro crema - This was a fantastic amuse-bouche. I've never had a pickled green bean before, and it was super tart in the best way. The cilantro crema was delicious. + Laughing bird shrimp ceviche - I could've licked that bowl. The shrimp was tender and juicy, and oh the combination really transcended the sum of its parts. I felt kinda bad because a busboy kept trying to take this plate away and I was like \"Sorry I'm not done\" because I was trying to politely scoop up the liquid with my spoon. :x + Foie gras \"al pastor\" - Such a creative take on a taco - I loved it. The foie gras was buttery, rich and creamy, and the grilled pineapple and achiote really elevated the dimensions of this dish. + Lamb chorizo meatball sopes - This was my least favorite of everything we got because I generally don't like lamb (unless it's doused in cumin), but it was still a solid 4 stars. The lamb was really tender and perfectly made, and it was definitely a great dish. + Roasted bone marrow tacos - I was going to say \"This was def my fave savory dish\" but then I remembered there was more. And honestly, they're tied. This was SO incredible - every component tasted so luxurious and mind-blowing at the same time. Chorizo ... marmalade? Asiago ... chicharon? Bone marrow ... in a taco? WHAT? And somehow, they all worked, and perfectly together. This is food I'd imagine they'd serve in heaven. I don't deserve to put this in my tummy. But somehow I did, with great delight, and great regret when it was finished.+ Seared scallops, \"fideo\" pasta - So I totally thought the bone marrow would've been the highlight of my meal, but no, it continued to stay on that high note. The scallop was the perfectly seared scallop that I haven't had since the Washington Duke Inn in 2012 (omg 6 years? @_@) and the pasta was the pasta that I've dreamed of all my life. It was al dente, but beyond al dente - chewy with a buoyant texture, super flavorful and addictive, just absolutely incredible. The asparagus and corn also worked magic here. + 1/2 pekin duck \"carnitas\" - Although duck is probably my fave animal to eat, I was actually torn btwn this and the goat neck, which Alex recommended. As a Chinese-American, I was a little skeptical of this \"pekin duck.\" It blew my mind. (Okay, this meal just blew my mind multiple times). It was also huge - I was already stuffed at this point, and seeing this shocked me. To my surprise, I ate it all because it was just so darn good. The carnitas treatment really transformed this into a class of its own. It was a cross btwn confit de canard and Peking duck, which two of my favorite ways to eat duck. Perfectly crispy skin, perfectly juicy and flavorful meat, this was something I could've eaten on its own. Amazing. + Grilled carrots \"elote\" - This was the most luxurious carrot I've ever eaten. I was sooo full after the carnitas, but I also couldn't help devouring this. + Jasmine flan - THIS. OMG. This was the most well-executed flan I've ever had the pleasure of eating, and the jasmine notes were subtle and perfect. Raymond usually doesn't even like floral stuff, but he loved this. Actually, he usually doesn't even like dessert. + Churros - By this time, Raymond declared he was no longer eating anything so he took a bite and I got the rest. Perfectly crunchy, flavorful churro on its own, but sooo amazing with the passionfruit sauce.+ Midnight in Paris - So good we ordered two. As you can see, I've run out of space. Xixa is perfection.

Foie gras dish and the pork belly dish melt in your mouth and the hamachi has the perfect amount of delicious yuzu sauce. Bone marrow and the crispy duck were also incredible. So fatty and yummy!! The truffle gnocchi was not my favorite. I think the gnocchi was made of plantains? I could be wrong but it tasted different than normal gnocchi's and it was just ok.

There were three desserts: churros, ice cream with chocolate cake, and 2 pieces of house made white chocolate. Good, but nothing to write home about. The waitress was attentive enough and nice.

I feel like it was around 10 courses total! By the time we were nearing dessert we were almost too full to eat anymore. Upon entering Xixa we were greeted by an extremely welcoming host and seated at a cozy table for two. Xixa is a little more viby, dark and hip than Traif and a little bit bigger inside. We thought the frozen infused ice cube drinks with tequila would be fun to try, but in reality these were the only less than perfect part of our visit. The infused cubes don't really melt quickly enough, so halfway through the meal we had a half melted blob of fruit but no booze left. We ended up switching to wine all of which was lovely. The wine selection here is massive!We had so many courses during our tasting that I lost track. Really what still stands out most in my mind is the Grilled Carrots \"Elote\" dish with honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, & dill. If you don't do a tasting menu, do not leave without tasting this dish. It's like liquid crack! I pretty much could have just eaten 20 of these alone for dinner. The edamame was so good that the person I was with who usually hates edamame even loved it. The pork belly, scallop ceviche and fish tacos were also standout dishes. The service was on par with the best fine dining restaurants I have been to. Every plate was explained in detail as it was presented by our waitress, and every dish came out perfectly timed and coordinated. By the time our dessert came we could hardly finish it we were so super full. We had a few bites of the churros and a chocolate caramel dish and they were unbelievable.

I also snagged corn from my neighbors since they left and had two lonely corns left. I couldn't let it go to waste! He actually suggested it and I committed the crime. The corn was as expected; it's hard to go wrong with spicy creamy roasted corn."}, {"date": "12/4/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely amazing restaurant experience here on a a Saturday evening. Every dish was better than the one before, from the unique ceviches to one of the best hunks of meat I've ever had at a restaurant, that being the goat neck tacos(pic included). Perfect little uni bites and very unique and delicious veggie dishes. The chef surprised us not once but three times with little dishes that came complimentary, one at the start, a caviar cornbread bite in the middle and a little post dessert fudge bite. The flan was delicious and the cilantro ice cream was super refreshing. Service was very nice and the place appeared to be managed well.

There are truly no words to describe the enjoyment my wife and I experienced, but we will try. \u00a0We chose this cozy perfectly dim lighted Williamsburg spot to be our first dinner as husband and wife and it did not disappoint. While this was the first time for me, my wife had been here before. Every aspect of Xixa was as well thought of as their eclectic menu. We tired 7 dishes and each was better then the last. The bone marrow tacos was a first for us and we couldn't have been more stunned with the level of flavors and richness. The edamame and Buffalo corn were just bursting with just the right amount of spicy. The pumpkin tres leches was personally my favorite and it is a must order. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal. Alex was our server and was a pleasure to talk with. He brought us complementary flutes of champagne and coffee flan which was to die for, but the entire staff was courteous and professional. Every plate was explained to us when it was brought to the table. Alex took the time to bring us two cocktails based on our desired tastes which certainly did not disappoint. Overall this was an outer body experience I have never had with a restaurant and my wife whole heatedly agrees. Xixa is a restaurant that every single person in the area and the world should try. We will be back this week with both of our families and will continue to come as often as possible.12/4/17 - This was our second time, but this time we brought friends. They were as blown away as we were out first time there. This time we were able to try a lot more dishes and each dish didn't disappoint. I honestly dream about the food that Xixa makes and how much passion, \u00a0effort and vision goes into each dish. It's really remarkable. The service was as always, top quality and It was a pleasure to have Alex waiting our table.

Initially, I wanted to take them to Traif but they were unable to accommodate my group of 15. Luckily, Heather saved the day by quickly suggesting we try her other restaurant Xixa. Let me start off by saying I've never experienced so much warmth and love at a restaurant as I have at Xixa. The only reason I even remember Heather's name is because we basically became best friends since I called her a million times asking to change small details in the reservation and dinner. My friends even asked me after dinner if Heather and I knew each other before we came to the restaurant. She was patient and kind every step of the way. I even told her that I was allergic to stone fruit and when the guacamole appetizer came out, Heather brought me edamame so I wouldn't feel left out. Isn't that amazing? The wonderful experience bled into the dinner, our server Sarah (I hope I got her name right, she's the waitress with the short blonde hair) was attentive and sweet AND her assistant. I can't remember his name but he was HILARIOUS - maybe it was Marco? We all did the $55 tasting menu. I asked Heather if the tasting menu is fulfilling when I initially called and she straight up said 'People usually beg for us to stop by the end.' She was not lying. We had 10 courses and I think by 6 we started to slowly put things into to go boxes. This dinner was a couple of weeks ago but I still dream about the braised short ribs, the bone marrow, chicken lettuce wraps, and risotto. I want to end this review by saying not only is the food great but the people who run this restaurant are simply amazing people. My family and friends visited from Houston where Hurricane Harvey happened. They're all safe but my family lost the first floor of our house. It was my sister's birthday and she planned this trip way before the Hurricane happened and it was tough for her to leave my parents' back home. The Xixa staff made us all feel at home and went the extra mile to give us a special experience.

Arctic char tartare: good, but there were so many different flavors that the char itself was hidden. Burrata with masa cake and mango: ok. Roasted scallops with sea urchin: absolutely delicious. The scallops were beyond tender, and the topping was mouthwatering. A must. Bone marrow with squid ink tortilla: good balance between the bone marrow and the sweet tortillas. Foie gras al pastor with pineapple over French toast: phenomenal. I don't think you can taste anything more heavenly than this. Get it. Short rib with plenty of sauces: huge portion of tender meat coming off the bone; great sauces coming along. You will not finish it. Buffalo style corn on the cob: tasty; a good palate cleanser after the meat. Espresso flan: very yummy. Churros with chocolate sauce and passion fruit cream: a great ending.

No complaints"}, {"date": "5/6/2015", "star": 3.0, "review": "In the search for the best Chinese delivery in my neighborhood (Cobble Hill), my girlfriend and I one night took the 3 best reviewed places that could delivery to our address and ordered the same thing from all three places (pork fried dumplings, chicken lo mein, and general tso's chicken with brown rice) and had a taste test. We tried Happy Garden, China Wok, and Hunan Delight. All three had the same size and quality of brown rice and arrived in 26-32 minutes. Here I present the other conclusions of that test:Happy Garden: In the middle in terms of pricing (China Wok was $17ish, Happy Garden was $23ish, and Hunan was $27ish). They used reusable plastic containers for 2 of the 3 dishes but they were too thin and cheap to actually use again. The general tso's chicken was made with bite sized pieces but was very average in that there was a lot of breading that was not crispy and they used cheap cuts of chicken and included very few pieces of broccoli. The sauce was sweet with no kick or real flavor to it. The lo mein was also very average. They were our number one choice for dumplings. The dough was properly thin and they used tasty meat and included a decent dipping sauce. Unfortunately they were no longer crispy but that could be expected from delivery I suppose. China Wok: This was the least expensive of the bunch. Everything came in the typical disposable tin containers. The general tso's chicken had larger pieces than Happy Garden and more broccoli but was also average at best in terms of quality and taste. The lo mein wasn't that good as the noodles were thin and not chewy the way lo mein should be. The dumplings were also extremely doughy, the meat had little flavor, and they did not include any dipping sauce. They too were not crispy at all and did not seem like they ever were. We threw these away. They were the only one of the three to include a can of soda but did not let us know this ahead of time so they chose Pepsi for us (which neither of us drinks).Hunan Delight: At over $27 this was the most expensive of the three places. It did end up being our favorite of the three but not by much. They included a nice thick reusable plastic container for the two main dishes. They were the only one of the three to include fortune cookies. Their general tso's chicken also lacked a crispy texture or high quality chicken but their sauce had slightly more flavor to it, though not by much. The lo mein came with properly thick and chewy noodles with the best flavor. It also came with a bunch of mushrooms which could be a pro or con depending on who you ask, we're not big mushroom eaters but picking them out wasn't a problem. The dumplings were disappointly doughy but had much better flavor and better seasoned meat than China Wok and came with a dipping sauce. The downside besides the non crispy thick dough was that they only gave 6 dumplings while the other two had 8. The conclusion was that if we're hankering for dumpling delivery Happy Garden is the way to go, if we want chicken lo mein then Hunan Delight is the best choice, and if we want general tso's then it's really a crap shoot as no one in our neighborhood seems to excel at this dish, a slight edge goes to Hunan for flavor while if price and having a bit more broccoli is important, China Wok would be the better choice. We'll definitely have another round with the next best 3 choices but it will be awhile before we can justify gorging ourselves on Chinese like this again."}, {"date": "6/4/2014", "star": 3.0, "review": "I wouldn't change from my current take out Chinese food spot for this one. \u00a0It was edible. \u00a0Nothing more, nothing less."}, {"date": "4/15/2014", "star": 4.0, "review": "Just finishing the last bite of my egg roll...I'd be hard pressed to find better Chinese food \u00a0for the price.

Inside the establishment, there's a mural of Chinese celebrity caricatures and on the opposite wall, there are real photos of celebs that dined there. I can recognize a few faces.The tables are lined with pinic cloth style tablecloths and a glass or plastic top on top to keep it clean. The menu is slipped in between for ease of viewing. This is efficient, less time wasted waiting on someone. I'm used to seeing this in many Chinese establishments. Onto the food, I came to try the HK style rice noodles, judging by the photos I saw on Yelp, I knew they served it. \u00a0While tempted to opt for the street vendor cart minutes away as I'm in Chinatown, I had time to spare so I chose to dine in. The service is lacking energy but when you're in a place like this, a casual homey fast food joint, they don't care so much the service. They care more about the speed. So it's a highly efficient way of doing things. The HK style rice noodles were delicious. I loved the peanut sauce and the way they drizzled it on top. The noodles were not sticky and perfectly steamed. The price also can't be beat. Street pricing but with the dine in seating, a total plus.I also ordered the Fried dough wrapped with rice noodle. That's a typical HK breakfast favorite. In fact, two tables ordered it after I did and then I overheard other patrons afterwards trying to order it and were told it was sold out. People, I was here at 9am!! Wow. But believe me, it's hard to find in many restaurants past the morning Rush. Quantities are generally limited and it's a favorite. This particular one, the fried dough seemed over fried. Too crunchy and too fried. The outer layer is supposed to be crisp but the inside of the dough is supposed to be pillowy soft. I was a bit disappointed it was not. The rice noodle was fresh and fairly thick. Sauce was on point (it's the sweet soy).Just because I had to try one more tasty thing, I ordered the waffle with peanut butter and condensed milk. Very similar to the HK style French Toast but served on a waffle instead. This was really a sweet treat. Fun dish, brings out the kid in me. So the run down, come for the Hong Kong style experience - menu and variety. But skip it if you don't want to share a table or feel rushed. This place was packed by the time I left, 9:45am. I took longer than they normally prefer but I was in no rush and I ate my breakfast slowly. At least it was a great value.

I was pleased about that. So I ordered the ham omelet platter that came with toast and some french fries. The omelet was a little thin and runny. The ham julienned and plentiful. And the onions were unwanted. I had no idea that it came with onions. I was taken aback by that and scooped them out. We also had the beef steamed rice noodle. Yum, yum, yum. I grew up with eating rice noodles and loved MSC's rendition. Just enough soy sauce surrounding them to leave an empty plate. The french toast we had left me with a smile on my face and a tango on my tongue. This was not your flimsy, lifeless piece of bread, this was like challah bread on steroids and testosterone. A light batter blanketed the french toast along with a lofty dollop of butter. I swore that I wouldn't finish it. I swore wrong. And this all for $12.75 well, and a Coke.

They use the same sauce for the rice noodles and pan fried noodles but I personally prefer the pan fried one. It's not offered at many restaurants so it's definitely worth a try. The outside is crispy, but the inside still has the same texture as the regular rice noodle. The baked dishes were good as well. Generous portions of rice and meat. All baked dishes are topped with a fried egg now! FYI Cash only! Plus the service isn't the best so come prepared. But, I do love coming here because it brings back so many childhood memories.

What makes milk tea Hong Kong is a blend of various grades of Ceylon black tea, which are brewed in a long cloth strainer and strained multiple times before mixing with evaporated and or condensed milk. The tea is very potent and aromatic. M Star Cafe does their tea right. It's potent enough to stand up to a large amount of milk, which gives it a creamy body but does not water down the tea flavor. This place is a bit hard to find, as it's hard to tell, from looking through the window, that it's an HK cafe. You need to look for the address and the restaurant sign.

I thought it was ok but I've definitely had better. The consistency of the rice noodle was a bit too well done. Like any noodle, al dente! I also got the HK toast- it's a fried squared HK style french toast with a by Dollop of butter. You'll be given maple syrup for it was well. Inside was nothing. I was hoping to get the one with peanut butter or jam, make sure you emphasize that. I didn't like this because it was oily AF! And seeing the butter melting in made me feel like I was going to die of clogging of the arteries. I stopped myself after 2-3 bites. HK style milk tea (hot) - regular. You can skip it.

Some of the sets can go over the aforementioned price, for instance, if you want to add an egg (which is + $1).

I ordered a round for friends and gave them, the bartenders (Daniel and Cori I believe) my card. About 45 ish minutes later I go to close out because I had to leave (had an early day Saturday,) and after a few minutes, they come back and tell me they do not have my card. They gave my credit card to someone else. They closed my tab, charged it, and gave it to someone else. This is not ok. Maybe, maybe, had it been obscenely packed and this happened I could chalk it up to mistakes happen, but never have I ever heard of this happening since I have been able to go to bars. The thing that bothered me the most was the way they handled it. They said I wouldn't be charged for the beers (they already ran it and I am still waiting for it to drop off my statement...) and if I left my name and number they would call me if they got it back. Uhm, seriously? Come on. We all know that I had to cancel that card as soon as I walked out of that bar because they had given it to a stranger and I had no idea where it was or who had it. My beers you charged me for already being reimbursed and your fake attempt at help do not make it ok.I reached out to them on Facebook and received a reply from someone named Dan on Saturday. Dan did not give a shit. Of course, he apologized for my inconvenience and said my card was returned and I could come pick it up.

Pony Bar usually has a few of their beers at a time on tap which is awesome! I was recently here for the anniversary party, and they really upped their game. They had such rare beers such as the Alchemist Heady Topper (rated the best beer in America) and other IPAs from Hill Farmstead as well. They also have a \"passport\" where they keep track of the beers you've had if you're into that. They give you prizes if you get to I think 100 beers. They also have pretty good food here. I'm partial to the calamari here which is excellent.

I came here on Friday night around 10:30pm with three other friends for a bite to eat and a drink. We saw that the kitchen was open late, it was close to my apartment, and that the food on the menu looked good so we gave it a try. We each ordered a drink (2 budlights, a pinot noir, and a pinot grigo). The drinks were all fine. Foodwise we ordered: a grilled cheese, the pimento grilled cheese, and two short rib grilled cheeses with two Cole slaw sides and two potato chip sides. The food came out quickly which was great and the chips and cole slaw seemed homemade and were very good. My short rib grilled cheese looked amazing when it came out but after biting into it I was not impressed. The sandwich was soaked in grease and it did not have much flavor. My two friends who had the grilled cheese and the pimento grilled cheese said their were good but also a little greasy.Overall, the place has a cool chill vibe but I do not recommend the food."}, {"date": "5/4/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "Excellent selection of craft beer.

Once we had time to investigate the local food scene and with some disheartening 11:30pm \"Kitchen Closed\" phone calls, we decided to give The Pony Bar a try. The bar wasn't too far from her apartment and we just wanted to grab food and a drink, since it was so late we weren't looking for a fine dining experience. \u00a0 As we walked into the bar, we could see that this was the typical late night bar, and we didnt mind too much. We scanned the room and pretty much all seats and aisle were filled with people, after a few moments we lucked up with a table. Once we got settled, we checked out the food and drinks menu. Since we didn't want to loose our seats, I took the first shot of ordering at the bar. I was annoyed to see only 2 bartenders, both of whom were on opposite sides of the bar not paying any attention to the people in the middle. I waited a few moments and happen to see i guy who also was trying to order, he mentioned waiting for a while since neither of the bartenders left the ends of the bar. Once I was given that info, I gave the centers a little more of my time, then headed to the ends of the bar to see if i could make better headway. I waited at the end of the bar after allowing some short convo, and had to grab the attention of the bartender to finally get my order in. I ordered a cider and the Pork Belly Cubano-Which was really good. My friend ordered the Lamb sliders and a stout. She was pleased with her meal as well.

The fries okay, they reminded me of the fries that are usually in a diner, not too impressive or crispy just there, which okay because they weren't the hero of the dish. Overall my meal was so filling I couldn't eat another bite. Even my mom was full, she had the fried fish with fired eggs and grits. She was so full but was hypnotized by the dessert selection they had displayed that she insisted we get dessert to go. We got the banana pudding, sweet potato cheesecake, and a slice of cake.

Key lime was very good even though Im not a huge fan so I was surprised to like it so much. The NY cheesecake was probably my favorite flavor but I wouldn't describe it as cheesecake. Sweet tart was on point and better than your average. Tahitian vanilla was alright and kind of a strange flavor to pair with frozen yogurt because the yogurt flavor overpowers it.

This time I found the new York cheesecake to be a fine balance between taste and sweetness. Pretty simple set up. Grab your cup and pour to your hearts content and then top it off with all the sweet goodies up front. For the health conscious like myself there's enough fruit options to make it worthwhile.

I just came home from 16 handles on the Upper East Side. The employee in question is Fatsu and the Manager who watched and condoned the whole situation is Danny. As you know, given the multitude of emails you send to me, that you run friday happy hour specials. I appreciate these offers as I've always gone for a 16 handles at least once a week because I do enjoy your product; and always tell people that its a much better product than Pinkberry. While your costumer service has always been subpar, tonight was outrageous. The lines today were very long and curved through the store. Given the design of the store, I could watch the cashiers work. I saw that every single customer was either being automatically credited or automatically offered the happy hour special between 5-8PM. Tonight (2/24/17) the special was free froyo up to $4. The only customer that wasn't offered this special was a Chinese mother and her three children. It was very obvious that this lady struggled with english. She was charged 16.70 for the four froyo cups that she and her children filled up. At this point, I stepped in and asked the cashier to separate the orders as they were technically 4 people and should have been able to take advantage of the happy hour special. The cashier looked at me and said \"its already in the system.\" After three or four exchanges of me asking why she cannot just cancel it out or issue a refund, she flat out refused to refund the money and reprocess the order. I asked for the manager who also confirmed that she cannot reprocess the order because of the system. Even if the Chinese lady couldn't take advantage of 4 free cups, she should have at least received $4 off the entire order. This didn't happen either. What if this was your mother being taken advantage of just because of a language barrier. For shame!! I couldn't sit back and not say anything because just the idea that someone might do this to my mother upsets me. When came my turn. The manager stepped in to cash me out. Again, he gave me and my boyfriend trouble when I wanted the happy hour special. Mind you, I'm also Chinese. Except, thankfully for me, I understand English VERY WELL. As I was asking Danny to please apply the happy hour special on my order, Fatsu turned to Danny and said very clearly \"what a bitch,\" in reference to me. I directly questioned whether or not she just called me a bitch under her breath and of course she denied it. The manager, Danny, said absolutely nothing and stood there staring at me. I am hoping that, given what I witnessed, this wasn't a racist, xenophobic issue against customers of Chinese descent, or your employees taking advantage of people who don't speak Engish. However, again, it really seemed like this was the case since we were definitely treated differently than the other customers in your store. I am hoping that this was the case of a lazy employee, an incompetent manager and the necessity to better train your employees on how to use your systems. If this is the case, I really hope that you can at least issue me an apology for being called a bitch and also make it up to that Chinese lady. While I was eating my froyo, I spoke to the lady explaining what had happened to them. We exchanged information and I told them I would try to help them get some fairness back in either a credit or a refund. However, the lady doesn't speak English and her daughter is too young to be involved in this kind of ugliness. It would show some corporate decency if you could send me a refund for them that I could forward to the lady and her kids for next time.

Stick with hard liquor neat/on the rocks.) At 54 Below, you hear Broadway actors (or aspiring Bway actors) just singing their faces off for the joy of it. I've heard lots of stars I couldn't afford to see in their hit shows. You also hear the best non-musical theater singing, folks you won't hear playing the smaller rooms. I particularly like hearing original material. Some Broadway performers started out, young, as songwriters. So you hear multi-talented performers wearing different artistic hats. The 54 Below Sings.... series is always a blast. I reviewed the Ingrid Michaelson installment in the series last year and still remember what a good show it was. The amazing Drew Gasparini is a regular (sort of an unofficial artist-in-residence) and his \"posse\" so much fun: Andrew Kober, F Michael Haynie, Alex Brightman. The food is excellent. The chef is a veteran of Union Square Hospitality and was exec chef at Danny Meyer's MoMa restaurants (one casual, one fancy). Get the cheese plate when in doubt (or not super hungry). For 16 you get a basket of this wheat/raisin thin crisp bread and also thinner sourdough. The soups are all great, as is the steak tartare appetizer. I've never had a bad meal. The mac and cheese side is a perfect portion served in a cast iron ramekin. They changed the fries and they're not as good (too thin). Onion rings are decadent. Cocktails have held at 16 dollars for years. Wines by the glass are pricey but you get a decent pour--AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT PRESS. They treat press like absolutely s***. Now that I am paying for my own tickets and 25 minimum (unless TDF, where cover is waived and you get about half off), I'm no longer mad at the horrible management (and horrible apologists on Facebook lol). I finally learned in the course of interviewing a New York singer WHY the club is so inhospitable to all the non-stars who play there. If you're Sierra Boggess or Laura Benanti, well of course, everyone treats you well. But I have witnessed poor treatment of artists more than once. The club was in the red for a long time. When they brokered the deal with Michael Feinstein (he got a ton of money, apparently), the club got a shot in the arm. But the owners/investors are Broadway folk. They know literally nothing about running a nightclub. Margins are low. They thought they'd just throw some money into this and the name would carry it. Also they made errors in the early days in pricing of tickets. They also train the hosts to be aggressive and snooty. It's actually deliberate. Think Soup Nazi but the cabaret/nightclub version. Interesting. I felt so much better when I realized what was going on, who the villains really are, and why this unbelievable attitude. But the shows here just do blow out of the water anything at any other cabaret room. The talent=A listers. It's pretty and comfy and I'm grateful it exists--now that I have 1) figured out why I've had such unpleasant experiences as a critic and 2) changed my relation to the venue (become a paying customer). Also, when you're not a critic (writing for no pay and getting two house glasses of wine), you get better treatment even at the front desk. The servers were never the problem. Once, a longtime cabaret veteran (also a jazz artist) saw one of the investors LAY HANDS on an old patron, trying to clear the room for the 9:30 \u00a0PM show. What. A. Dope. You never do that. But again, ownership is arrogant and ignorant (a bad combination: we see the effects daily of this with the current POTUS).The bathroom is great: they pipe music in there so you don't miss a song if you go to the bathroom during a show.

This was the case most recently when composer David Yazbek and singer/actress and all-around talent Katrina Lenk (he composed the music for The Band's Visit and she is the female lead) were doing an early show. Premium seats were expensive ($150) and there is a $25 minimum, but just hearing her sing the song Omar Sharif from the show was priceless. Just a few other observations. The sight lines are all good. There are no physical obstructions. Tables are tightly packed. Shows only last about an hour. You can eat before or during the show. I've never had bad service--in fact I've been impressed by its efficiency and hospitality. The decor is sort of retro speakeasy. Lots of gilding. Broadway Rococo style. Long flight of stairs down.

It's a small, intimate venue with no bad seats in the house. They have a large range of up and coming and huge Broadway names. You're Always in for a treat! :) The staff is always super friendly!The downfall is the prices... you pay for the ticket and then have typically a $20-30 food/beverage minimum however everything on the menu is expensive and a challenge to hit your minimum closely. So be sure to budget accordingly. Even with a steeper price ticket it is absolutely worth it to see one of your favorite stars! They often hang out afterwards as well so there's a good chance you can meet them! :) be sure to bring your own sharpie if you want them to sign something. The seating is not reserved by tickets, it's all at the discretion of the host staff. So if you are going with a friend, you need to either purchase tickets together or call ahead so they can accommodate you. The location is great! Very close to the theatre district!

For years, we've been trying to find an upbeat and festive place to go in NYC on Christmas Eve. Was thrilled to hear that Feinstein does a holiday show as he's an amazing artist. Bought tickets for Christmas Eve the moment they went on sale. Then in my excitement, I found and listened to an interview he did on WNYC a few years ago -- and was suddenly a little concerned. He basically dissed holiday music. But still said he included it in his holiday show. I figured OK. Temperamental artist -- can't be pigeon holed. At least it will be 50/50. Imagine my WTF realization that his \"holiday\" show was a tribute to Judy Garland. Not holiday music. Christmas Eve and $100's wasted. $100s. It ain't a cheap place. I literally sat there with my head in my hands as he sang (wonderful) Judy standards. Any other day but not tonight. During the main set he worked in a sad Judy X-mas song -- which would have been lovely had it been surrounded by other holiday songs. Finally after all the Judy classics he came out for an encore. 2 holiday songs. And here's the sad part -- they were amazing. Beautifully arranged and performed. The 2 songs were the show we wanted to see. Michael clearly does not want to do a \"holiday\" show. Fine. So don't advertise that it is. Or let a performer who would like to do a high quality holiday show take the stage on the big holiday nights. $100 and $100 of dollars down the Christmas Eve drain ...."}, {"date": "12/13/2016", "star": 5.0, "review": "Perfect stage seats.

And so, I did the first night I arrived, right after watching the Kinky Boots musical! Talk about a great night, right? Seemingly crowded at every hour of every day, this Shake Shack location was especially busy when I came around 9:30pm because of the rush from post-musicals in the area. Despite this, it seemed they had anticipated for the rush and were adequately prepared to serve the massive line up. The wait was minimal and I was pleasantly surprised by how fast we got our food. Seating was a bit difficult to find but since it's a fast food joint, the turnover of standing tables was relatively fast. The burger was good. That's what I'll give it. Not the most delicious burger of life but definitely a GOOD fast food burger. Not too greasy, not too salty, the meat was meaty, the lettuce was green, and the tomatoes were red. It was everything you'd expect a burger to be! At first, I thought the price point was a bit higher than normal but now in retrospect thinking about all the food in Manhattan, I'd say it was actually reasonably affordable.

If you love red velvet, it tastes exactly how it sounds - a red velvet cupcake in a cup. If you want to try what I think is the best shake on their menu and like vanilla and chocolate, the Black & White shake is the way to go. My most recent visit I got a beer since the ones in New Jersey aren't allowed to sell beer in their restaurants and it was refreshing and had a fruity taste to it (it was a Brooklyn beer I believe).

I always get the plain lo mein and singapore mai fun and my boyfriend always gets the Kung Pao Chicken.I can't speak for the bad reviews listed below, perhaps the business was under a different management. However, I absolutely LOVE this place. And did I mention you get a free soda if your drink is over $10 and delivery is free if your order is over $6!!!Things I've Ordered:Kung Pao Chicken-delicious, comes with your choice of rice; the quantity is HUGE. I can never finish one by myself. The chicken is not that spicy, for my tastes but that's because I have a very high spice tolerance! Their hot sauce is great so I usually go through about 4-5 of those little packets of heaven.Lo Mein- I recently learned that if you get plain lo mein its $4.50 and if you get chicken lo mein its $4.75. I have yet to try the chicken lo mein but I heard it's really good, and the chicken they use is decently cooked and isn't sus looking, like the rest of the Chinese places in Harlem.Singapore Mai Fun- DELICIOUSSS; just note that if you just say Singapore Mai Fun they'll put shrimp and chicken in it, I usually just get vegetables because then they give more noodles! Things I've heard are really good:Orange Chicken- heard its pretty good, but personally I would go with the Kung Pao ChickenSpare Ribs- apparently these are amazing? Or so my coworker says? Jk, but everything is pretty good here so give it a try if you're in the hood.Hope this helped~Xoxo (:"}, {"date": "8/4/2012", "star": 2.0, "review": "After the other debacle, I decided to give the neighborhood one more chance to redeem itself in this area.

Furthermore, when I told her it tastes like water, she shakes her heads, glares and blames it on me for asking for no ice.

I hate leaving the little leftover burned bites when I want to gobble down a sandwich whole. The Coco Tomping is a customer favorite and I see why. It's not overstuffed, making it easy to eat and savor, and that chicken cutlet was a hefty well seasoned piece. You get a good bang for your buck with this sandwich, I was full for the rest of the afternoon and well into the evening. There's a customer appreciation program for every ten sandwiches bought (I think salads may count too) and you are automatically enrolled on your first purchase, which is great because I always forget all those little punch card things.

I chose the cajun chicken for my salad and found the chicken very tasty and just the perfect amount of seasoning. complaint was that my beets were super hard and maybe I'm lazy but I found that I just needed to chew a lot to eat the beets, also I like my salads chopped to make the distribution of ingredients blend better.

A $5-6 sandwich made for a perfect midday snack, although I don't think it would make for the most filling dinner.My only complaint is the wait.

A tip I have is always ask for your bill as soon as you're done ordering because the bill doesn't come out to the end of the show and then for them to actually take your card, you're waiting another 20-30 minutes.

My friend and I shared a great bottle of wine and the sommelier was able to help us choose a fantastic red from Portugal. They happened to be sold out of many of the less expensive bottles on the menu ($45-55). They have a good variety of wines at almost any price from $45-$200+.Overall, I recommend City Winery for a show. It's a comfortable setting with good sound. It would be a great place to take your parents or go with a group of friends.

I ordered duck tacos, shishito peppers, risotto balls as appetizers for the table and the burger as my entree. My friend \u00a0ordered the steak. None of the food except the shishito peppers was good. The medium rare burger was inedible and half of it was burned. In the dark I didn't realize till I had a bit of it. I told about it to the server and thankfully they took it off the check. It is not about money though. I am very disappointed that I couldn't get a decent, edible meal. My friend's steak was tiny and sad. The duck tacos was the worst duck tacos i have ever had. It looked like they heated up some frozen shredded duck, sent it with the most tasteless fresh avocado paste I have had (Not guac, no onions, no flavoring, and warm), a ton of onions. First of all duck tacos is a big thing in NYC right now. It's everywhere from Masa to steak houses, from some upscale diners to hipster bars. But none of these places serve shredded, frozen duck. They serve beautiful, tender pieces of duck meat in tacos with real sauce / salsa / guac etc... Also at City Winery, you have to build your tasteless tacos, in the dark, while the band is playing, into a supermarket bought soft tacos. I had better tacos through delivery. At a beautiful place like that, with such good music you expect the food to be much better. There are about 15 hipsters walk around pouring wine, some of them are sommeliers, most others look useless. You can't just run a place on the principle of \"look good good\". Winery is a beautiful space, with great music but unfortunately the kitchen adds nothing to this. I don't blame the kitchen for this. I blame the ownership / management who don't care enough to make it a better place. Side note: Shishito peppers were excellent.

Due to the size of this place unless you get seats up close its somewhat too large for intimate type shows. The food itself is tasty enough and their selection of wines, as expected, is quite large. That said service is very disorganized, in part due to their set up of waitresses taking your order and busboys/servers actually bringing out your meal. Our side order of carrots came out way before our entrees, when the entries did show up, the burger order was wrong and had to be sent back and they redelivered another order of carrots that , once we told the server our order had come much earlier, was taken away. Their mistake , they should have been left especially since the burger order was wrong. \u00a0I also noticed servers not knowing where to bring the orders, with one poor soul actually going to the wrong table four times before finally finding the correct table. This would not happen if the waitresses actually followed the order to delivery, or at least check in once and awhile to see if the order came in properly. \u00a0My conclusion is this is a good place for catching some good musical talent and having some wine along with music. It's not a place to have a meal unless you are ok with hit and miss service. \u00a0Unrelated to the above, my friend ordered the tickets for tonights show months ago and is fairly sure she ordered table seats. When we got there we were seated at high chairs. About 20 minutes latter a hostess came to us and asked if we were in the right seats,implying that someone else was supposed to be sitting there, and perhaps we were in fact in the wrong seats.

As my burger came, a passing customer told me this place and The Spotted Pig have the best burgers in town, which I can't confirm the latter yet. But he was so right. Granted the potato wedges on the side were minimal, but the focus was on the burger and it is one of the best burgers I've ever had--charred, juicy, tender, and rich in flavor. Despite it being a fine mess, I felt like I hit jackpot when I took my time to devour it.My friend, on the other hand, was less than thrilled with her Mac Daddy.

The food is delicious, the drink and wine list is awesome, and the decor is really fun. I made an OpenTable reservation for myself, my husband, and my brother prior to celebrating my husband's 30th birthday. We arrived early for our reservation, but were told it was no problem and were seated immediately (the restaurant was almost empty at this point, without anyone at the bar either - it was early on a Saturday night, so totally understandable as to a lull). We sat there without menus, water, any acknowledgement that we were there, for literally 25 minutes. 25 minutes, where our server (we later found out) was walking by us, with again, no notice or acknowledgement that we didn't even have menus in front of us (and the reason I know it was 25 minutes was because I checked my phone when we came in, realizing we were there early). It seemed like the staff was huddled down the end of the bar, paying no mind to people who were waiting. The only reason we didn't walk out, was because we were on a tight time frame and didn't want to chance long waits somewhere else, since again, it was a Saturday evening, now approaching 7 PM.My husband ended up going up to the bar to explain that we hadn't so much as received a menu yet, and was told someone would come over immediately. Five minutes later (this time after people who were seated after us had already gotten water, menus, etc.), our waitress came over and gave us menus and took our drink orders.From there, the experience was significantly better - and honestly, worthy of at least 4 stars, if not more. Again, my 3 star does NOT reflect the food or the drinks, simply the bad start of the dinner to begin with. Swine has a bunch of wine on tap, so I ordered the Pinot Noir, which was delicious. My husband ordered the Rye and True, and my brother ordered the Tokyo Black Porter. Drinks came out relatively quickly, and we then put in apps and meal orders.My brother and husband got the potato chip nachos, which they put DOWN. For entrees, I had the Kale Caesar salad, which was the perfect portion, my brother had the bone marrow and brisket burger (he'd never had bone marrow before and is now a convert - he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had), and my husband had the pulled pork sandwich. During our meals, we each ordered a second drink, because Swine really is the kind of place that you want to spend time in. So again to sum up - I would give Swine another chance and hope for the best (and would ultimately update my review upon a better experience), because the food really was so good. Unfortunately, no matter how good the food/drinks are, bad service leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and sitting for 25 minutes completely ignored/unattended is something that's hard to bounce back from."}, {"date": "6/28/2017", "star": 4.0, "review": "A very pleasant dinner.

My friend and I made a reservation for 8:45PM on a Saturday night at last minute. \u00a0They sat me once we got there even though my friend hadn't arrived yet, which was nice. \u00a0The atmosphere was fun and probably not for the faint of heart; it was super dark, loud, and the tables were close together.When my friend arrived we ordered a round of drinks. \u00a0Mine (the Boulevardier of Broken Dreams) was nice, although I didn't really get \"bacon-infused\" bourbon vibes. \u00a0My friend ordered the Au Pear's revenge. \u00a0When she got it and took a sip, I could immediately tell something was wrong. \u00a0She stirred it around a bit and then slid it over the table to me and asked me to try it. \u00a0It was SO sour I had a throwback moment to another Green Day era-esque item- the War Head. \u00a0I practically begged her to send it back for her own sake. \u00a0Our server complied but made a comment about how \"no one ever sends it back\". \u00a0Not sure if he was lying to us or if the other patrons here just don't have tastebuds. \u00a0Regardless, it was a little annoying that we were being made to feel guilty for sending it back- this drink tasted like someone just squeezed lemons into a cup, put it on ice, and tried to pass it off as a cocktail. \u00a0Fortunately, the food was pretty good! \u00a0We ordered the shishito peppers, the tuna tacos, and the bone marrow + brisket burger.SHISHITO PEPPERS: Perfect amount of char and heat, served in some sort of doctored lime sauce that I wanted to take with me to go. \u00a0I would probably eat anything prepared this way.TUNA TARTARE TACOS: Three tacos. \u00a0It is really hard to dislike raw tuna, so these were naturally great, although surprisingly spicy with the jalapenos. \u00a0Didn't love the spicy mayo on them, but thought this was a refreshing snack for the most part. \u00a0BONE BARROW & BRISKET BURGER: Nice sized burger, accurate cook, awesome caramelized onions. \u00a0Did not get much bone marrow though- deconstructed the burger to figure out where it was and could essentially not locate it. \u00a0For an ingredient that is listed first in the name of the menu item, you'd think I'd be able to point it out (although I do have to say, it was insanely dark in this restaurant). \u00a0Great burger regardless. \u00a0We wanted to order dessert and it took a long time for our waiter to come back to us. \u00a0The service as a whole was not a high point of the meal; our server was missing for long periods of time and was difficult to flag down. \u00a0At the beginning of the night, that was totally fine since we could tell he had a lot of tables, but at the end of the night, the place cleared out and he was just nowhere to be found. \u00a0However, there was one busser who was AWESOME. \u00a0He actually took our second drink order, checked on us periodically, got us our bill, etc, and was extremely nice. \u00a0For dessert we got the chocolate bomb, which is another item that is pretty hard to dislike. \u00a0It reminded me a little of the Chili's molten lava cake (*OK, so sue me, I like an item from Chilis) and was served with some sort of ultra sweet/sugared (?) fruit and ice cream that they told us would be vanilla but I'm almost positive was salted caramel (no complaints).All in all, our bill came to about $110. \u00a0I felt like that was an accurate price for what we got and I was happy with the meal overall. \u00a0Aside from the one drink and the somewhat inconsistent service levels throughout the night, I had a good time at Swine and would consider coming back. \u00a0Well, maybe after my next quarterly exercise."}, {"date": "3/5/2017", "star": 5.0, "review": "Very cute, cozy environment at Swine.

They texted me the day before about my reservation and easily made changes for me via text when I said I needed to increase my group numbers. Upon arriving, we were promptly seated downstairs. I love the vibe of this place and overall felt so nice and cozy inside. Drinks: They have a pretty extensive drink menu, which I love. However, our party decided to order bottles of wine instead. Easy selection and not overly pricey. Food: The food was pretty darn good in my book. Foie Gras Torchon: Delicious. Though it looked like plain old pate, the taste and the texture of this was delicious, truly melting in your mouth. Must get. Roasted Bone Marrow: Came with two large bones filled with marrow in salsa verde sauce. I'm usually more of a fan of bone marrow shining more on the plate without extra sauce, but this was pretty darn delicious and creamy. Pan seared ribeye steak: Boy, this was damn delicious. I didn't really taste any jalapeno puree, but I really loved this dish with an interesting take on its sides. The ribeye itself was cooked to my perfection ( medium rare) and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the kale and the asparagus underneath the ribeye as it added a nice contrast to the hearty taste of the ribeye itself. Great dish. Overall, I really loved the food here.

Obviously we all wanted to eat together, so it was disappointing to be spending more time staring at the kitchen waiting for the food to come out than enjoying it together. However, when the food finally arrived it was delicious. We spoke to the manager to explain our disappointment and asked that we get a discount/drinks on the house and he agreed to comp desert. After paying, he also brought us a round of shots.

The fellowship was great, but the service...not so much. To say the least, our server (FiFi...if that's even her real name) was bad. Let me count the ways:- When I showed up it took over 20 minutes for her to even acknowledge our table. And this was after multiple attempts to get her attention and then basically going to the bartender and having him send her over. I'd be a little more understanding if the place was packed but it wasn't. Not a good start to our waitress/patron relationship. - We would finally get a hold of her to order drinks and rather then handing the drinks to those who placed the orders, she basically just dropped them on the table for us to sort out ourselves and then sped off. Like she didn't want to be bothered. - The table was packed with empty plates and glasses! Almost to the point where the new drinks wouldn't even fit on the table. You think FiFi gave a damn? Nope. No \"can I get these out your way?\" \"Are you guys finished with these plates?\" \"Lets clear some of this stuff off so you can have room.\" Nothing. We had to pretty much grab her during one of her many trips pass our table and ask if we could have the table cleared. - On top of the service her attitude wasn't the greatest either. Not once did she stop to check on us. We always had to stop her usually after 15-20 minutes of getting no attention. And when we did stop her it was as if we were bothering her. Like she just wanted us to leave her alone and let her continue passing us by. I get people have bad days and I'm not expecting you to have a cheerleader type of spirit but a little goes a long way and we didn't even get that. Tavern 29 isn't a definite no for me because I have been there prior to last night and had a good time.

Tried nutella gelato, original tart, sweet coconut, and cookies n cream, and the nutella gelato by far is the most delicious in my opinion. Super creamy and actually tastes like soft serve nutella. The location is great in The Plaza's Food Hall because you can walk around, explore the other places, and eat elsewhere too. Two negatives of this froyo place: very pricey (69c/oz for froyo only, 79c/oz if you get froyo and toppings, and 89c/oz for toppings only). This is about 30-50c/oz more expensive than other froyo places, which don't differentiate if you get just froyo or with toppings too. Another negative is that it doesn't have any seating area, and the other seats in the food hall belong to the other eateries so you can't sit down in the hall without infringing on another business's space. I took mine to enjoy in Central Park, but then you risk it melting on your walk to the park. Overall I'd come back because the nutella gelato is delicious, but with the price and the lack of seating... not sure if it would be my top pick.

The server more enthusiastically suggested I choose a salad with the pasta appetizer, which boasted of porcini pur\u00e9e and blue foot mushrooms. What I received was a plate drowned in cream sauce with two or three tiny pieces of mushroom. It was inedible. If I'd dumped a ton of salt, I might have improved it enough to eat but even then it wouldn't have tasted like mushroom. I took two bites and pushed it aside. Minutes later, the dish was removed from the table with nary an inquiry into why it hadn't been eaten. \u00a0Dessert (profiteroles) was mediocre at best. Total disappointment. I was not alone. Second, if you want to eat with the rest of your table--like have an actual meal together--this is not the place for you. The servers delivered our plates at the rate of 2 every five minutes. Dishes served first were ice cold by the time the rest came out. This was true for every course except dessert. Third, if you sometimes like to use the restroom before, during, or after eating, this is not the place for you. Did you just drop four figures on overpriced drinks and less than mediocre food? And now you want toilet paper, too?! Unreasonable! The bathroom is in the hotel and as they will tell you in the restaurant they don't control the bathrooms. So, sorry, you're out of luck. If none of this matters to you, and you like overpaying for bad food in a city teeming with delicious options, make a reservation now. I'm sure they have availability."}, {"date": "7/17/2017", "star": 1.0, "review": "There is a good reason why this place has three stars. I took clients out for lunch today.

The plate arrived with one normal looking meat and the other one pretty much a bone. I told the waiter that doesn't look right. He was agitated and said \"Osso Bucco is bones\". I looked at him with surprise as he simply walked not caring a damn. If I was the manager and my waiter talked to a customer like that, he will be out the door. I walked away with pretty much no food on my plate, still hungry. I would normally have asked for the manager if treated this way but had to stay quiet as I was with my client.

From the beginning there were errors. As my wife had went to wash her hands, the waiter comes by and shares the specials to only myself. After that we ordered a number of dishes as we were excited to sample Chef GZ's awesome cuisine. Soup and salads were brought out by another server or runner and were auctioned off at the table, to top it off the server places my salad down first before leaving my wife with soup and no spoon. I would have expected to have had the cutlery placed before the food. I requested a spoon for my wife and one was brought. We ate our first course, and the bus-person comes and clears my wife's soup leaving me to eat alone in front of her. I was also served first with water, food, etc. Please remember it is still polite to serve the females in the party first. After this, the food is cleared and the next course is brought out and once again we have an auction going on. Please, there are table numbers and seat positions for a reason. Not once, throughout the whole night did one member of the staff inquire as to how the food was, if we needed anything, or even if we would like another drink when removing a glass. Missteps in service can be overlooked if the food is exceptional, this was not the case. Out of all the dishes we ordered, the only one that we said we would order again was the brussel sprouts. I rarely add salt to any dishes when dining out, however the dishes were lacking seasoning. The asparagus and fava beans had no flavor, the mac and cheese tasted like Valveeta, and the Branzino was placed on a bed of ice cold artichoke hearts, hearts of palm and other Mediterranean flavors making it soggy on the bottom. On the Petit Filet, the hen of the woods mushrooms were very slimy and bland. Chef, I know you are busy, but please head over to The National and see for yourself if this place truly represents you. My wife and I love experiencing the cuisine of our favorite chefs, and this was a huge disappointment. Even after we finished, and the bill was placed, not once did anyone inquire if we enjoyed the food, if we were pleased or how things were. I hope that Chef GZ or a staff member of his actually reads this as it is not how I believe he would want to be represented. We are leaving NYC and it is with this experience. Once again we love what Geoffrey Zakarian does, but the National Bar and Dining Rooms is not a place I would recommend to anyone.As a footnote and to be transparent, the manager of the restaurant called me after I left the restaurant and apologized, inviting us back. I had used open table and they had my cell number.

Decor: Long ago when I started to visit NY often, 1992, my father's friend would take me to places like Atlantic Grill, Gotham, Quatorze Bis and other grills. This is in the best tradition of a grill, but it's in Midtown and full of business people. Further uptown, at least on weekends, it's not all suits. I love the simple white/navy/wood decor. It's bright without being obnoxious. The bar area is killingly loud. At 7:30 I was quite anxious because I wanted to be able to catch up with an old friend and the bar is NO place for such a meeting. Happily, I had made a reservation and got the best table in the dining room, or one of them, a corner banquette. My friend was late and they didn't bug me about just sitting there 30 minutes. I ordered one martini but waited to order more till friend arrived. The entrees are definitely high. 30-42 about. The lower cost dishes: their famous burger and lamb burger. Not sure if it ranks with April Bloomfield's signature lamb burger or my friend's South African interpretation but I saw one go by while waiting and it looked delicious. But the appetizers are big and if you stick to those, you're in better shape. If you did entree plus appetizer, the bill would get high. 1) Steak Tartare: It's not in a patty as is traditional. Wonderful interpretation I'd have again. Nice portion. A bit heavy on the mayo or whatever they put in it but not overwhelming and plenty of flavor. 2) TRUMPET pasta! Blue note or some kind of fancy mushroom. This was more than enough for an entree portion and if not with friend going out after, I'd have taken it home. Service was good.

We arrived a little before 5:30pm and had a tiny bit of a wait. We were then escorted upstairs to a table for 4. We ordered guacamole and chips and drinks to start. The guac was so good! I ended up with an open-faced quesadilla and BF had the ceviche. BF's dad and girlfriend both got a fried cricket taco. I tried one. It was ok. I'm not sure I would order it on my own. Dessert of churros and a crepe cake were both OK - nothing special to write home about. Service was quick and food came out pretty quickly as well.

Although it doesn't look like much from the outside your opinion will change once you step inside. The restaurant is split level, always vibing, always full and managed by lovely staff. They definitely pack the tables in there and a reservation is a must, it is constantly busy.As others have said the portions at this restaurant err on the smaller side for the price. At places like Dos Caminos or Fonda you will definitely get more bang for your buck. However for the area it is pretty good value. The tacos are on the smaller side (2 per serve) but are padded out by the rice and beans. I think the enchiladas are a decent size.When I went for lunch today we ordered mild guac, vegetarian enchiladas (me), chicken enchiladas (my dining companion), a side of rice and beans and two cocktails each. The mild guac was tasty, of course way too many chips and not enough guac (isn't that always the case?). I would have ordered a medium spiced one but that comes with pomegranate etc and we weren't sure we wanted to complicate it. The enchiladas were really tasty and a good size, I had to box up most of them. The rice and beans were good but I probably prefer the ones at Fonda - these ones were less creamy/blended. For cocktails I tried the grilled pineapple/jalapeno mezcalita and the mango/tamarind one. \u00a0The first one was definitely dominated by jalapeno and the latter by mango. All in all very good drinks, boozy enough and not too sweet.With the exception of one fairly apathetic female sever all the other staff were lovely, friendly and attentive. Fortunately we were not stuck with this server as everyone jumps in to give a hand, run food and check on you. We even spoke to a manager who was really friendly.A few other thoughts:#1 - \u00a0going to the restroom is a bit of an ordeal if it is busy (and you happen to be sitting downstairs). You need to push past everyone milling in the doorway to get up the stairs, walk through a bunch of tables on the next level and then gather to wait for one bathroom. I guess there isn't much they can do about that because the space is quite crowded/utilized to maximum capacity.#2 - I wish they served the poquito picante cocktail here that they serve at Toloache Thomson (damn that is such a good drink).#3 - As it gets very crowded the place gets noisy. And as above...a reservation is a must.All in all I have nothing but warm feelings towards this restaurant.

When I arrived I still had to wait 15 mins for a table. I had a mango frozen margarita and a lime frozen margarita. It was very watered down. For appetizer, I had the guacamole with fruits and the truffles quesadilla. They were both really good. This was my favorite course of the meal! For the main course, I had the shrimp tolache and carne asada. The shrimp tolache was just mainly shrimp. It was a very average dish and definitely not worth the price. The carne asada was much better but the beef was tough to chew. There is a ton of better Mexican restaurants in NY. I wouldn't suggest this place."}, {"date": "3/23/2018", "star": 5.0, "review": "I've always wondered what it would be like to attend a fine dining Mexican food restaurant. Well, now I know, and I will never be the same after eating this awesome food.First off, let's talk guacamole. Guacamole and me are never far apart from each other, and here, at Toloache, they serve three different kinds of guacamole (my heart). I loved all three of them, but the most interesting and most delicious was the pomegranate guacamole. Refreshing, light, and full of flavor, you have to try this, and I guarantee you will never have one like it again. Second, if you're in the mood for a summer-y drink, ask for the watermelon lemonade. Not too sweet, and the flavor is so nice. Third, one word, TACOS. I don't think I've every had more delicious tacos in my life. I opted for the Lobster tacos, which were so delicious, and I was shocked at how well the corn tortillas stayed together. Usually I'm not a fan of corn, but these were really something else. Finally, MEXICAN HOT COCOA. If it's a cold day, I would highly recommend trying some. It's a very unique flavor. Just super impressed by the service (which we got our food in 20 minutes for a group of 5), the food, and the space itself. Very homey but fancy feeling still.

I sat and ate at the bar which was okay. The Toloache drink was delicious and I probably could pound a few of them! I only had one though. I already imagine a horrible hangover from that. The skirt steak tasted and smelled too meaty like they got it from a cheap butcher shop or a stop and shop. I couldn't finish it because of the strong meat smell and it was a bit too chewy. I asked for medium but probably got a medium well to well done."}, {"date": "3/15/2018", "star": 5.0, "review": "What a wonderful find. Really elegant but with a relaxed feel.

Yes, it's in the Theatre district and just off Times Square, Yes, the space is wonderful and service very good, but if you're going to charge these prices for Mexican food, the portions should be larger than what's offered.
