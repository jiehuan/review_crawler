It was Sunday so I just had French fries $6 and wine, a French rose for around $11 a glass. \u00a0The bartender was kind of rushed and impersonal. \u00a0Food and drinks were as updated and on point as the decor. Yeah the place had a kind of hotel feel about it but I liked that. \u00a0The food menu looks good, and so did the plates of food sitting under the busy mouths of happy diners.In summary This historic old bar in south street seaport has a new clean ambiance and is convenient to lower Manhattans east coast view, walking trail and ferry terminal. \u00a0Not cheap but still a decent value."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "review": "This review is of the bar - I didn't check out the dining room.

This was met by the manager storming out and demanding we pay $3 for a basket of bread and that it's only included with soups and salads. It's not a matter of the price or seemingly ridiculous policy, but rather that he couldn't have been more rude and abrasive. After this encounter we canceled our order, which was well over $100, and we were met with more rude behavior and comments rather than doing the right by your customers.Save your time and money, there's many great places to eat in this area."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "review": "This is the best sesame tuna in town that I tried.

It's an old establishment so the decor is beautiful. In fact quite fancy compared to the usual NY Irish pub. We were seated at a table that had a nice leather bench. Main reason I wanted to leave the review is because the food was REALLY good. I had the slow braised lamb shank, the others had the NY steak and the crispy skin salmon and everyone was very happy with their entree. The lamb shank was really delicious.

He did nothing. What a joke. Upon asking for the bill, the bartender returned with the wrong one containing several food items that was clearly not ours, at least to a sober minded person. My friend and I were in exceptionally good moods that evening where as normally the bartender and manager would have gotten an ear filled with our dissatisfaction and offensive service.

Neither bartender seemed to have any interest in acknowledging us and it took somewhere between 10-15 minutes for the stout bearded one to serve us a drink. We had no interest in sticking around and when the bartender finally came back to serve our check, he was so drunk he would have stood out in a St. Patrick's Day parade. He tried to ring up an entire dinner and did it on a card that didn't belong to us. He could hardly speak. The other bartender came over at that point and settled up our tab without apologizing or even acknowledging the other bartender, like it was no big deal.

For brunch they serve $15-$20 plates, which comes with a free alcoholic beverage (bellini, mimosa, bloody mary, screwdriver). I think it's a good deal considering the good quality of the food.

We used to get a pie that cost $5. Now the same pie will set you back $8 to $9. The $10 pie with 3 toppings will cost you $14.

Also, the only upgrade made by this \"new\" management was the prices. The food was almost the same as the old Pecorino and the sauce seemed a little sparse.

To start off, I thought the ordering system was pretty good, and especially great if you're the type of person who doesn't like direct interaction with people. Basically it's a computer and you go up to if and either select a specific stir fry recipe or you can create your own (which is what I did). Then all you do is swipe your card (or insert cash) and wait for your food. The service was great too, even though there isn't exactly a wait staff, several workers did stop by to check up on us throughout our meal. They were also super friendly. The downfall though was the food, maybe it was just an off day but I just really did not think it was super fresh tasting, despite watching them cook it (which was a perk). I felt a little sick afterwards too. Honestly it was probably from the sesame garlic sauce rather than the veggies but I just felt so so gross afterwards and the food was overall lacking in flavor anyway. Maybe I'll come back one day and order something different (without the sauce) because it's so convenient but the food definitely was disappointing."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "review": "In and out, it is not however delicious and tasty it is!

I ordered the red coconut curry and I hate to say it but nothing about these noodles tasted like coconut or red curry. The noodles themselves tasted rather bland and were too oily. I had to add a bunch of hoisen, sriratcha, and soy sauce to even taste any flavor. The tofu was very bland, even for tofu. The menu said seated spicy tofu, but it was not spicy at all. It's possible that this could be their blandest dish because it was their only vegetarian option (many places forget that veggie dishes can have flavor too), but if that's the case, I still would rate this place the same. The veggies in the stir fry were fine, and the rice noodles were cooked okay, just very little flavor. I like the touch screen kiosks to order (gave me time to look through the whole menu without rushing). And I thought that the flap down number board was a cool, shout-free way to find out when your order was ready.

The egg noodles were good, but the veggies were kind of lame. Just a crap ton of green beans, and some bell peppers. It was largely brothless too, even though it's listed as having broth. And I thought the sauerkraut would be interesting, but it was unevenly distributed and gave random bites of sour. The pastrami was okay. As sodium filled as you'd expect, and just a few thin slices.

Yes, they to take the dessert business super seriously! They were busy with dessert lovers, taking time to get some afternoon sweets and relaxation.Towards the front entrance, they have baked goods and some savory offerings like croissants and sandwiches, and behind the baked goods are the sweets! They had all sorts of sweets displayed as if they were precious gems and treasures... And if you are wondering \"what about drinks?\" not to worry, they have that covered too. They serve all sorts of coffee, and also some tea, hot cocoa, and chai. If you want to fancy-up your dessert experience, they have wines and cocktails too! At the back, they have a small seating space. There is no \"host/hostess\" there, so just ask one of the staffs behind the counter.They have two kinds of afternoon tea offerings. \"Tea with the Queen\" which is the standard, and then \"Afternoon in Paris\" which comes with champagne. We went with Tea with the Queen. The amount we received was kind of small, compared to other afternoon tea places I've been to, but then again, it is much more affordable than the other places too.Tea with the Queens comes with sandwiches, warm raisin scones, petit gateaux, confections, and choice of tea. On the top tier, they had some macarons, chocolate, petit four, and caramel-looking thing. The second tier had three desserts that were larger than the ones on the top. Only at a dessert boutique, you get two tiers of sweets with afternoon tea. The bottom tier had sandwiches. They were more of an open-faced sandwich, or rather bruchetta. I was a bit sad to see that we only received one of each, which makes it difficult to share... Maybe they could either give us two of each, or serve them pre-cut in half so that it would be easier for the customers. Yes, I do prefer if they gave us two of each so that we can both enjoy the whole thing...When we were about to get into the middle tray, they brought us scones, hot out of the oven!!! From the photos that I have seen, I thought we only get two scones total, but we got four!!! Yes!!! I don't know if they serve four scones now, or maybe because our server was simply awesome...We enjoyed everything, including their tea and of course, all the sweets. The sandwiches were tasty also, and the scones were great. The staffs were mostly very nice and friendly. We were taken care of by three staffs, maybe they don't have a particular server section method, as most other restaurants do? But our main server, Hector was awesome!

However, after receiving rude disrespectful service AND lack of concern/care by management I refuse to step inside this place again. I highly suggest you spend your hard earned money at a place that doesn't discriminate based on how you look! Updated overall rating: F-! STAY FAR AWAY! FULL HORROR STORY: I came in on April 10, 2018 looking for some tasty treats. The employee helping me had a bad attitude from the start. I tried to let it go. I was greedily looking forward to devouring my pistachio kouign amann and black sesame kouign amann! I was charged for BOTH items totaling $10.07. However, I overheard the customer right behind me get offered a buy one get one free discount on the kouign amanns by a second employee. I thought it was just an honest mistake. When I asked if they were indeed BOGO, the first employee who helped me came back over briefly just to yell belligerently at me, \"NO! THEY'RE NOT! THEY'RE NOT!\" Instead of getting the manager or doing ANYTHING to help resolve the issue she escalated, she literally ignored me, walked away, and started to joke with another employee. I just couldn't believe what happened. I wanted to cry! Who treats another human being like that?! Especially a paying customer?! Luckily, a third employee graciously stepped in. He said he understood I was overcharged and offered to refund me for the lower priced item. I agreed. I left and will never go back. I couldn't even eat my 2 kouign amanns after that disgusting experience! I suspect the lack of proper customer service was fueled by discrimination. I'm a young looking Asian woman and I was wearing my ugly workout clothes. The customer after me who was offered good customer service and the BOGO promotion was an older, well dressed Caucasian woman. I don't think it was mere coincidence that we were treated differently based on our looks! With these higher prices, I expect at least mediocre service. They couldn't even deliver that!I tried to contact management multiple times this month to urge them to train their staff better or else they would continue to lose loyal customers. Shirin wrote back promising management would be in touch back on April 19. It's now April 26! I'm done wasting my time with a company that obviously doesn't give a damn about their customers. Chef Rory Macdonald- I still adore you and your food/drinks! Your one employee needs improvement desperately! Too bad I can't come back and purchase that celebration cake for this weekend and future special occasions, show off this patisserie to my friend that's visiting NYC next month, enjoy another dessert tasting with my friends, partake in your afternoon tea, or try new seasonal treats. Good bye and good luck! You're going to need it with your current staff! If anyone from management actually cares to investigate: The time stamp from my receipt was April 10, 2018 at 6:12:58pm. Transaction 600034. Order: 583. Don't worry. I've learned my lesson. I won't hold my breath this time waiting for a reply or expect to be treated to proper customer service.***EDIT 4/27/18***Dear COO Andrew, To clarify I didn't \"use the race card\". I was describing how we looked. The full descriptions stated: \"I'm a young looking Asian woman and I was wearing my ugly workout clothes. The customer after me who was offered good customer service and the BOGO promotion was an older, well dressed Caucasian woman.\" I was pointing out that I looked younger and was dressed in my sloppy workout gear. In comparison, the older woman was nicely dressed. In my experience, older and more well dressed people tend to get better service (probably since they look more well off and hence, may give better tips). I'm glad your company is Asian owned and 43% Asian employed. We need more of that! Not sure how you figured out your clientele is 78% Asian without giving everyone DNA tests to check their race. That seems questionable to me, but I'll take your word for it. Let's take a break from each other for now. Once my heart mends, maybe I'll return. Until then I'm seeing other bakeries.

It's not bad for brunch either. I got a cup of coffee (adorably came in a little saucer) and a smoked salmon Benedict. The drizzly fried eggs, the flowing fresh salmon, and the bread - oh my, that thick, juicy bread - came together perfectly and it was the prettiest Benedict I've seen. The prices are on par with brunch places nearby. I wouldn't say that the smoked salmon Benedict was worth the price, but I did enjoy hanging out in such a bright, pretty, and airy little bakery.

Immediately after I nearly choked on the \"amuse bouche\" - a large droplet of gin aperitif that underwent spherification, wrapped delicately in ribbons of cucumber, held together with the tiniest of wooden cloth-pin, and popped determinedly in your mouth - I turned to my boyfriend and declared that this was already a better time than Alinea. Rory Macdonald is not messing around. We've all seen the viral videos of dramatic Eucalyptus bowls overflowing with smoke, meringues piped onto miso-cashew pastries and torched on your plate, and flaming apple brandy poured atop apple tatin; in person, the showmanship is still grand but grounded by Chef Rory's team bustling around to plate each dessert course in front of you. Rather than detract, the spectacle intensified the experience as plate after plate of carefully crafted desserts appeared in front of me. The experience begins with some savory bites - tandoori popcorn, truffle arancini, and pancetta flavored crisps - to prime your stomach, followed by three sweet dessert entrees, an interlude with a more savory miso tart served on a block of Himalayan salt, then returns to two more sweet courses before finishing off with the best alcoholic gummy bears you'll ever have. The wine and cocktail pairing was extremely thoughtful; usually, I pass on pairings because 1) I don't want to get drunk and forget about the meal and 2) the pairings aren't tailored very well. I understand that it's pricey, but if you can swallow the price tag, DO NOT SKIP THIS ONE.My favorite course was the second - rooftop honey, meringue, barley ice cream, mango yuzu parfait, honeycomb candy all paired with a bubbly Moscato from Piedmont. My complaint at Rouge Tomate was that the rooftop honey was gimmicky and the lack of character in the honey was covered up with a lavender base. This was not the case here - the honey spoke for itself and bounced of the sweetness of the candy, the toasted flavors of the barley ice cream, the tartness of the parfait and returned to the bright honey flavors with a sip of the light but still potent Moscato. Really, very well done. Another moment that made me chuckle was the Andalusian Sherry (!!!) pairing. The jammy sherry wine with the peanut butter dessert was a tongue-in-cheek nod to PB&J. From my understanding, they're starting to switch out different courses to eventually serve a completely different menu. Needless to say, I'd love to come back once the new tasting menu has been fully rolled out. Molecular gastronomy / progressive cuisine is gimmicky, so bravo to Chef Rory for orchestrating an excellent show that stimulated all the senses without losing sight of his story and the underlying ingredients."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "review": "This place is a very modern, fun version of a bakery.

They have a nice chat with you and help you out explaining some of the unique menu items. I just docked one star b/c of one staff member who is really a misfit amongst the others.

So used to places just raising prices with every menu change, so this was a nice surprise. Also, it somehow seemed to be an even better execution of the same sandwich at $8 than it ever had been at $12. I'll be back to order this much more frequently than I had before. They also added some omelets for you gluten haters out there. Coffee is Stumptown, so that's a major plus too.

The taste of this croissant we ordered didn't reach my expectation. It's full of chocolate inside and outside. I like the inside part with a little crispy mouthfeel and the soft taste of the croissant. But the surface is covered too much cocoa powder, which discounts the complete mouthfeel of the croissant. Also, this cocoa powder makes me feel a little choked in my throat without drinking.

Drop it onto your mouthMoliterno with Black truffle, crispy cracker - nice savory treat First dessertWine pairing - french 75, herbaciousOlive oil ice cream. The cocktail brings out the flavor of the olive oil and the eucalyptus smoke was a real visual delicacy. Smelling it made me feel like I was in a spa.

Cuts through creaminess. quite strongFourth dessertgin and sake infused with rosemary, cinnamon, cardamom, gin and sake. served warm. The contraption for serving this drink was very novel. miso pink grapefruit - served on a block of Himalayan salt. The salt and sweet contrast only gets stronger as the dessert sits on there for longer. Cashew cookie. Miso tart. Meringue. Pink grapefruit sorbet is very tart. Fifth DessertCloverclub - vermouth, egg white, gin, raspberry Black sesame yuzu truffle - the dumpling has black sesame on the inside topped with fruit caviar. I felt like it was pretty basic, but that may be because I've had lots of black sesame before. Final desserttoffee apple tonka granny smith - Puff pastry, tonka bean, dehydrated apple. Tasted like an apple pie but more like a jelly consistency. 2011 Sauvignon blanc - honey, caramel. This was my favorite wine of the night. Final small treat.Gummy bears infused with different alcohols. Maro, tremburi, port, brandyFirst time experiencing a dessert prix-fixe. Ordered the wine & cocktail pairing. It didn't really enhance the desserts, but there was one really interesting drink that was sake infused tea. I'd rank the desserts as follows: 3,1,6,4,5,2. Music is a bit too loud for my liking.

Feedback for the restaurant: Loved the desserts, however, i think some drinks were overpowering. The herb/floral infused tea/cocktail was sweeter than the dessert itself so it took away from the delicate flavors of the dessert.

But when I tasted a sample of Chanson's pecan caramel one, I had to get one. The caramel has a deep, rich flavor and there were plenty of pecans. And the macaron looked gorgeous with metallic dust.Everything croissant - this is what I came for and it was pretty tasty. I could taste the garlic and onion flavor throughout the croissant, not just as a sprinkled topping. And there's a small spicy creamy filling inside that added an unexpected element.Apple butter kouign amann - I've had kouign amann from other bakeries but wasn't swayed by them.

Since the dessert bar is a speakeasy concept I had to ask the staff about where to go once I got to the store.

The service was absolutely impeccable from the moment we sat down. You get to meet Chef Rory and his whole team and everyone is incredibly friendly. Your night consists of a 6 course tasting menu and all of the dishes are prepared right in front of you. The menu is craftily curated to consist of a wide range of textures and flavors that all blend and complement each other very well. It's not your conventional idea of desserts as nothing is overly sweet like your typical bakery fare. Having the chefs interact with you really make you feel a part of the dessert making process and I was thoroughly impressed with every dish we tasted. The price tag is a little hefty but the entire experience is 100% worth it. The playlist was also spot on if you like vibey, chill music. We even had to ask the staff for the name of it!

The bathroom is the cleanest you'll ever encounter in an African braiding shop. The salon is also spotless because the owner gives licensing for cosmetologists so she sets the bar.

Please do not misunderstand...There are two top notch stylists in this salon, however the owner's attitude, inconsistent pricing system and wait times are hurting their reputation. I have come to Soween for almost two years (on and off) for my box braids. Each time I arrive, they remember me, remember the style I like, however the price is NEVER consistent, which I find disappointing considering my braids are always the same length and size. I recently decided to give them yet another chance. I arrived at 10:15AM. The salon opens at 10AM. 5 girls were already in seats with stylists so I would have to wait (completely understandable). What I did not appreciate was repeatedly being told that it would be an hour or so, when no one was available until 3PM. Yes, I waited 5 hours. I don't allow many ppl to style my hair, so I ADORE the two stylists I am always paired with, however they need set pricing, they should give out cash receipts, and should be honest with customers about estimated wait times.

I have never been on this site nevertheless written a review however after my experience at this hair salon I felt it necessary. The owner has reached a point in her career to where she could care less if you come to her shop. I am guessing she figures that she has made enough money off of her customers to where she no longer has to be respectful, or genuinely care about her work. She talks about clients in front of them, behind them and in as many languages as possible. I have watched it and selfishly stomached this behavior for years hoping that I could just mind my business and leave with a fancy do. It's not worth it. I have began my journey to find a stylist that has everything or at least half of what Soween, (owner)does not have. She is rude, arrogant, and phony. If it wasn't for wanting to keep a clean record and not wanting to be escorted out by the police I would have went off when she pulled her shenanigans with me. Instead I will never visit this place again and this business will not get another red cent from me. I feel guilty in that I may have contributed to her behavior. By patronizing this business when I knew this stuff was routine but yet sat back and pretended that the foolishness was not taking place. I am certain that she will continue to thrive but I can honestly say that if you are looking for a warm welcoming environment and great relaxing experience do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through this...

This salon deserves a negative star rating. First of all, they work on a first-come, first-serve basis. The system can possibly work but if this salon specializes in intricate braiding and twisting styles, \u00a0they take about three hours or more to do. In that case, they need to set up an appointment system. \u00a0So i get there along with six other ladies at ten o clock. Because I was there at ten but someone got there at nine fifty-nine, she got her hair done first. So, i waited till twelve thirty. The second girl got there before me as well and she was getting the Senegalese twists too. So again, i waited. And waited. Waited. Waited. \u00a0Went home and got a snack. Waited. Waited. Went to a deli and got a delicious roll sandwich. And waited. Hubby and son came to visit me. Hubby feels bad that i've been waiting so long. Oh, let me tell you the time : it was seven thirty. And waited some more. In between, i met some nice customers. Many of them had said, if they were me, they would've left. And really, i should've. At least this review would've been a bit nicer. But no, its gonna get worse. It was eight o clock and the young woman that was getting the Senegalese twists was officially finish. I was beyond aggravated but i just wanted my hair done because i was going away on vacation. So the owner now says,\" don't worry, three stylists will twist your hair so it can be done faster.\" Hell to f***ing no. I didn't want my hair looking crazy. So i decided to get the style that i had before (check out my Sol photo, Tweg is the bomb) and in my heart, i felt it was a disaster waiting to happen. First, she rips through my hair with the freaking blow dryer like she was raking leaves. It hurt like hell and i told her to be gentle. She kept saying my hair was thick and nappy. Thanks for the compliment. Strike two was the braiding. She was doing it very tight. I told her i have a sensitive scalp. She said she wasn't braiding my hair tight and it doesn't look tight. How in the world you are gonna tell me that it doesn't look and feel tight? Marinate on that thought, Yelpers. She then begins the braiding session again and it doesn't get better. By this time, i am completely fed up. My hair was being pulled so much, you can see my scalp pulling back as well. \u00a0I told her to take it out so i can go home. The owner and the stylist started speaking in their language. So the owner knocks off twenty bucks and give me some free bottle of some no name s\"**t. They keep telling me to stay and even though, i should've left, i waited over seven hrs to get my hair done and i knew the shit wasn't gonna look right but i just wanted it done.Long story short, she did it lazily and like i said, it was \u00a0freaking ugly. I paid, left no tip and walked home pissed off. My hair was so dry, she didn't put any oils or moisturizer in my hair and it was also lopsided. I actually had to fixed it to make it look half way decent but it really looked two weeks old. So i came to the conclusion, i will never step foot in this salon again.

They offer a wide variety of baked goods typical of many Italian bakeries and I've had the good fortune of sampling many of their offerings.

The sfogliatelle are pretty good as well - the outside was flaky and the filling had a perfect consistency, sometimes I find sfogliatelle filling too dry but Court does it justice. I haven't tried their famous lobster tail but I plan to in the future. Their cookies are just okay - some are better than others.

Similar to DiFara, walking in is like stepping back in time.

They also have absolutely giant Italian ices ($2 for \"small\") including a pistachio that, despite looking like real-life radioactive kryptonite, bears chunks of pistachio and full of flavor. There is one significant downside to the \"fat guy in a little coat\" style of serving it though which is that on a hot summer day when it is best enjoyed, it's going to drip everywhere, be forewarned. Tempting on a first date but it will test the limits of decorum.I'm pretty sure Court Pastry Shop boasts the city's cheapest full-size lobstertail ($3), the Americanized version (larger, sweeter) of sfogliatelle which they also have ($2.50) both of which I'd recommend, the specific choice depending on one's sugar strength preference. To find another bakery like this -- efficient with old school charm and delicious and affordable confections -- in the city one's other choice besides Carroll Gardens is Arthur Avenue in The Bronx and this is going to be more convenient for most of the Yelp demographic.

You would see a picture of Court Pastry Shop under the definition. Court Pastry Shop is by far one of the quintessential corner stone small businesses that make up Cobble Hill\\Carroll Gardens. The Good: The pastries, the cookies, the love for what people do in life, is fully expressed as you walk in the door to Court Pastry. If you're looking for a delectable treat, try the 7 layer cookies, made with a delicious apricot filling. The 7 layer cookies are a mainstay at Court Pastry as well as their variety of Coffee cookies. Another awesome favorite of mine are the cookies with the diced up nuts on top. I'm not referring to the pignoli cookies. I'm referring to the ones right next to the 7 layers. Moving from the cookies and on to the pastries, the variety of italian based pastries are enticing to the eye. Although the selection of pastries is not as quite as large as Ferrara's in Little Italy or Mona Lisa's in Brooklyn. But they do serve their purpose. The Bad: Unfortunately the only bad thing about the pastry shop is the line. I don't have a problem waiting on line. It's just the terrible people that you have to stand next to that mess up your experience.The Terrible: There's really nothing terrible about the food or the place itself. The only time, I've had the displeasure of experiencing something at Court Pastry was when one of the older bakers started hitting on one of the girls behind the counter. It's something, you really wish to not see at an establishment such as this; specially since it's been in the neighborhood for so long.What I would Recommend: Even though the building next door is currently occupied by some sort of fitness studio that is coming into the neighborhood. The owner of Court Pastry, should have expanded his business. Being that he does own the next building (information handed to me from one of the local blog websites), he should have expanded his store to include a sit down area to enjoy coffee and cake. This would've been a great idea for times like the summer. When you're waiting on line in the heat for one of their delicious ices.The Grade: I'm giving Court Pastry Shoppe and overall grade of four stars. This is due to my personal enjoyment of their food. However, they would have received a five star rating had I not experience the baker hitting on one of the girls and lightly tapping her on the butt. This is just bad taste in work etiquette."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "6/7/2014", "review": "I'll keep it simple:I've now been 3 times in the past week.

The wait is insane and typically disproportionate to your order (in other words, you'll wait 30 mins for a toasted bagel with cream cheese). If you're adventurous enough to brave this place on the weekend, I'd literally prepare myself for an hour-long experience, which, given the number of staff members behind the counters, just makes no sense at all. What compelled me to write this particular review, though, was my most recent experience, which occurred last Saturday. As usual, it was stupidly crowded but since I had anticipated this anyway, it didn't bother me much.The staff, though, is what bothered me. I swear, there must be thirty people on staff at a time, and none of them seem to do anything. When I eventually approached the counter to give my order, the mouth-breathing \"manager\" who is always wearing a black Yankees hat and just seems to lurk around and stress everyone out (customers included), shouted \"next\" into my face, then proceeded to look everywhere but at my face or at his notepad as I tried to give him my order (spoiler alert: my order came out wrong). I also noticed that once he was done \"taking my order,\" he simply walked away from the counter and someone else replaced him. I've also seen him handling food and making sandwiches. So basically he does a little bit of everything, and does it all horribly.Then, when I went to pay, apparently I pressed the wrong button on the Square tablet as I went to sign for my debit card transaction. This sent the girl at the register into an apoplectic meltdown. She literally threw her hands in the air, rolled her eyes dramatically, and began screaming for her manager, as I had apparently just ruined her weekend. Ultimately, when the issue was resolved, she slammed my receipt down on the counter without saying a word. She then forgot to give me an iced coffee, which I had ordered as well. When I reminded her, she also slammed that down on the counter. The irony is that I pressed the wrong button in an attempt to tip her. I definitely won't be making that mistake again. All while this was happening, another member of their NFL-roster-sized staff was shouting out orders. (As an aside - why do they ask for your name if they just yell out your order anyway?) A guy behind me approached the counter and said something like, \"Oh, is that a banana smoothie (or whatever he ordered)?\" and the girl responds, without even attempting to hide her disgust, \"Yeah, I looked you right in your face and called your name.\" And then - you guessed it - she slammed the smoothie down onto the counter. When I did eventually get my food, it was bad. Cold, tasteless, bland. Just bad. Bad enough to send me to Yelp to air all this out, while I had tabled similar feelings in the past because the food had been okay. But this experience sent me over the edge. Trust me, people. There are a lot of places to get breakfast or lunch in this neighborhood. There are also a lot of places to get breakfast or lunch in this neighborhood where the staff won't make you feel like a total idiot or blame you for not understanding whatever their system is, will most likely get your order right - and, hey, you might not have to wait half the day in the process."}, {"star": 2.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "review": "The bagels are good but the service is terrible.

The buns are English muffins which is cool and the burger itself hit the spot. Slightly on the high end. I had some of the frittatta which also was well prepared and large, perhaps too big. The issue here is the service. I assume the food took quite some time to prepare because it was pretty good tasting and presented.

I feel like that's hard to come by lately. We ordered an appetizer, but our entrees came out first (why does this keep happening to me?). So we passed on the appetizer, unfortunately, and accepted our entrees. We all got burgers (copy cats). My dad and I got fries with ours and my mom got spinach. It was so good!!! The burgers were flavorful and juicy. The fries were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the way you long for them to be. The spinach my mom had was so flavorful and yummy. During the meal, my parents said that Duffy's might have to take a backseat to Marie's burger (don't worry Duffy's, I'll always have a place in my heart for you).Last but not least, my dad and I chose from their extensive dessert menu to have cake chef cake slices which were the perfect ending to a yummy meal.

I'm going to break down this review in sections so you all can get a full grasp of why I gave it such a bad review.We'll start with the good.Food: I think the food is actually pretty great. They do a great job of having a lot of options on the menu. I'm a vegetarian and there is always a few things I can eat. The kitchen staff does a great job when it comes to taste and presence.And now we can go to the bad.Service: I cannot tell you how terrible the service is. They hire very young staff who care more about their phones than they do serving customers. Every single time I've gone a person from the waitstaff has either gotten my order wrong or forgot something but guess what they didn't forget...TO TEXT RIGHT IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS. I also went in and saw on of waitresses kissing yes you heard me right, KISSING someone else on staff...in front of customers once again. It was totally inappropriate and should be kept to the back of the restaurant or after their shift. I guess we were there on a busy day when a new girl started who was getting bullied by the older staff. It was very clear she was new but the older waitstaff kept alluding to the fact that she wasn't good at our table. Marie's you either need to hire new waitstaff or kick them into shape because this is a huge problem.Proximity: The restaurant is very small but they keep trying to do more with it. They have live music come in but squash them together between the bar and the tables. It is a terrible atmosphere for your customers when they can't hear anything! Please learn that it is not always your best option to have a live band there when you don't have the room for it.Cost: Prices have gone up and quality has not. I got an omelet and substituted my potatoes for spinach and they charged me $6.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u00a0At that point I'll make my own $18.00 omelet at home. Conclusion is that this place gets worse every time I go. Maybe its my fault because I keep going but there is this hope instilled in me that maybe, just maybe things will turn around."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2016", "review": "My family and I have been going to Marie's every week for about a year now.

Today we decided to give them a call to let them know that there may have been a bad batch of meat. We had no intentions to cause an issue or to lecture the manager but just wanted them to be aware as we all know accidents happen. However, when we called the manager had the audacity to tell us that we in did not have food poisoning and that there was no way it was their food. He responded with \"Oh that's funny because food poisoning only lasts 24 hours\". Not funny, at all. We weren't looking for compensation but just to open a line of communication.

I had to coordinate my wedding from across the country in California and therefore all my correspondence for around 5 months was just via email and phone, specifically with Bridget, Vice President of Events. What I thought would be a tough challenge with having to figure out all food and bar needs, party rentals as well as overall flow and added touches, was actually amazingly seamless thanks to Scoozi's knowledge and experience in such a variety of events! They literally covered everything I questioned about in regards to timing of the food and beverage services and coordination of delivery of personal items, etc. \u00a0The day of my wedding could not have been more prepared and have everything covered. \u00a0And because they do everything from food to event space design, they made our blank space of an open loft look impeccable with decorations that went with our theme.Now, let's get to the food. All I have to say is WOW. We went with a buffet style dinner that also included a bunch of passed appetizers during the cocktail hour, already plated salad and bread baskets at the start of the reception, and passed desserts at the end of the night. Their food is INCREDIBLE. \u00a0Super unique and amazing portions that left our guests full and blown away. Most weddings I have been to I am starving by the time it gets to dinner time- and I usually miss the passed apps when they go around, if they have any. \u00a0Scoozi makes sure that food keeps on coming during the allotted time scheduled. \u00a0The servers and bartenders were so kind and engaged with our guests, anything that came up was taken care of without hesitation.A final thing to add is the pride this company has all the way from its owners to the ground staff. \u00a0I suggested that it would be really cool if we had a featured San Diego beer (where my husband and I currently live), but I know there aren't many available to serve in NYC. \u00a0The owner, Gianluca, contacted over 20 breweries who said they were not allowed to ship any beer, but he still went out of his way to score about 4 large bottles of one of our favorite breweries for myself and husband to enjoy with any selected guests.

They provided us with an amazing selection for our first tasting, over a year in advance. We would have picked everything if we could. If you follow Scoozi on Instagram, you would most likely have a foodgasm as we did. Luckily, they allowed us to alter and add to our menu whenever I would see some of the new, and amazing things on their Instagram. The same menu shouldn't be offered for every season, that's one of the things we loved about Scoozi...their menus are fresh and in season.Their presentation is so gorgeous and clean, from the food to their staff. They even gave us the option of what the staff would wear on the day of our wedding. All of our guests raved about our caterer as all the staff went above and beyond to attend to our everyone at our party. We've been to weddings where dishes are just plopped down in front of guests and some people are eating while others are still waiting, but these guys were coordinated so well. Almost two years later and we still have friends and family telling us, \"I'd kill for some of those vanilla mashed potatoes/mini churros/scallops & risotto from your wedding right now,\" and we would too!Scoozi's preparation, presentation, quality, and care are everything one would hope for in a caterer, we couldn't give any higher praise. Thanks again!"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2016", "review": "Scoozi catered the food for my wedding, and I have nothing but praise for them, in regards to their quality of their food, the food presentation, and their service towards my family, my husband, and me. First, the quality of the food. Many of my guests remarked that it was the best food they had ever tasted at a wedding, and it was a posh crowd. Scoozi provided appetizers, the main course, as well as desserts. For appetizers/cocktail hour, the menu included Sushi/Avocado & Candied Pink Grapefruit; Pork Belly Slider with Pickled Watermelon Rind; Local Fresh Fish Tacos with Cilantro & Cr\u00e8me Fraiche; Kobe Beef Cheeseburgers; Petite Crab Cakes with Caper Lemon Aioli; Petite Grilled Cheese Sandwiches; Butternut Squash Gateau with Hazelnut Brittle; and Crispy Goat Cheese with Lavender Honey Aioli. Although we had done a first look, we were still taking pictures during the cocktail hour and Scoozi saved my husband and me a plate with a nice sampling. Everything was delicious, and their pairings were also so creative. I felt like our menu was really special, and it contributed to the joy of the day. For the main course, we opted for a buffet, and the menu consisted of the following: Kale Caesar Salad with Shaved Asiago & Homemade Croutons; Fresh Orange & Pomegranate Salad with Frisee Greens; Olive Oil & Sherry Vinaigrette; Organic Chicken Medallions with Mango Salsa; Cedar Grilled Salmon with Grilled Pineapple Salsa; Strawberry & Champagne Risotto; Tahitian Vanilla Mashed Potatoes; Grilled Local Organic Seasonal Vegetables; and Mother of Pearl Cous Cous with Golden Raisins & Yellow Sundried Tomatoes. I've attached pictures of these, and we were again really pleased at the presentation and quality. Finally, the desserts! At this point, the party was swinging, and Scoozi brought out the desserts to guests as they were taking a break from dancing or socializing. We had a bit of a problem where the guests who were closest to the door were eating all the desserts before they circulated throughout the room! We enjoyed Deconstructed S'mores; Assorted Mini Milkshake Shots; Petite Lavender & Raspberry Cupcakes; and Beauty Cr\u00e8me Brule with Custom Initial Logos. The S'mores were my favorite. They had a marshmallow on a graham cracker and then used a small pipette to inject hot fudge into the two. It was again delicious but also unique and a real party pleaser. I found Bridget (our main contact), as well as the owners, were extremely courteous and professional throughout our interactions. Location in New York City as well as the food quality were important to us, so we saved some money by having a buffet rather than a sit-down dinner. However, Scoozi never made us feel like second-class citizens. Additionally, they were willing to modify the preparation based on our preferences. The salmon was initially more sushi-style (not cooked through) but my parents were concerned that the more conservative guests would be put off by this style. Scoozi ended up fully cooking the salmon. Finally, everything went smoothly on the day of the wedding, and I didn't have to worry about a thing. I appreciated their preparation and care for the event.In summary, I was thrilled with Scoozi's service and quality. They even sent us a small thank-you gift, and I felt like I should have sent one to them instead!"}, {"star": 1.0, "date": "2/1/2016", "review": "We had an event at our firm and thought this was going to be fun for the employees. \u00a0When they came to us for the pitch we were amazed and we decided to have them cater our event. \u00a0Sad to say it was a major bust for the money we paid. \u00a0The energy at the event was absent and there was no direction at all with the staff. \u00a0From what I understand our firm called them and we expressed our unsatisfactory experience. \u00a0We tried calling the owner but never got thru because she or he was unreachable. \u00a0But you would think that management would tell the owner and maybe a call to find out what happened. \u00a0Never heard from them again and at the same time we felt that this horse was already dead and nothing would come of it. \u00a0 Sorry Scoozi, but because of the no callback I gave you 1 star as opposed to 2 stars."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2015", "review": "Friendly, professional, delicious: Scoozi Events is a pleasure to work with.I have had them cater two private cocktail parties in my home for 70 people.

We were craving for some Asian food and found Sakura within 7 blocks of our proximity, so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant was half empty (it was around 10pm) when we arrived and was super dimmed in attempt to create a 'romantic' vibe for the customers. We were given the menus quickly right after we sat down and I noticed there were broad selections of sushi rolls and some dinner entrees. I ordered the 3 roll combinations with the salmon avocado roll, tuna avocado roll and shrimp avocado roll (yes I am an avocado fanatic). My boyfriend ordered the stir fry chicken udon. The waiter also checked our IDs to verify our age so we can receive a complimentary shot of sake. Food arrived fairly quickly and we began to dig into our food.Food tasted nothing spectacular. You can tell Sakura is run by the Chinese and these 'Japanese' food are no where near authentic. The sushi tasted ok - it wasn't the freshest fish in my opinion, but still edible and won't give you a stomachache. The udon was a let down - tasted worse than your average Chinese take out and nothing notable at all.Dine-in service was an ok - our waitress was quick in getting our orders and bringing our food, but overall felt rushed as if she wanted us out of the restaurant asap to close for the night.2nd time (and probably the last time ever) was this past weekend when I was searching for noodle dishes in the area since I just had an oral surgery. I decided to give Sakura one last chance and decided to order the chicken udon in soup to go.The hostess barely made eye contact with me when I walked into the restaurant. I had to wave to get her attention and take my order. My meal arrived quickly in less than 5 minutes. I rushed home in hopes the noodles will wow me in some type of way... NOPE. It was ok (again it is edible but nothing flavorful to be noted) and the only good thing is that it was a quick and cheap meal (less than $10 since I didn't tip) to go.

We noticed that even the spicy sauces they brought on the side weren't spicy at all. Hubby's spice level is lower than mine.

The mole poblano con pollo was the highlight of the meal.

Even the rice and beans it came with were a welcome delight!

I want to give them credit for being able to handle lines of 20-30 people in under a few minutes. The service here is very fast however there is a caveat. With lightening-quick services comes a lack of quality as far as putting on toppings. The staff is very fast to help select the bread, meat, and cheese. When it comes to toppings they will ask you what you want and put on as little as possible to get to the next topping, and get you out the door. Every single time I am here other customers as well as myself have to request more lettuce, more onions, or more of the other toppings on our sandwiches. I actually expect it now.Overall they make a sufficient sandwich, as they should for a fast-food sandwich shop. I am normally in and out in under a few minutes which is great for anyone who works in the city. However if I wanted to sit at a table and eat, the seating is very poor, and other customers will constantly be walking right next to you and most likely bump into your table. The store is very clean, the staff is for the most part very professional, and this is why I continue to give this Subway business with 2 other locations within the same walking distance.I hope this review helps anyone in the area looking for a quick lunch.

Please note this because you may have a situation where you can't bring family or friends. i would say it fits up to 12 people approximately because about 3 of the seats are single bar stool seats if you come here alone. The second time I went here, there was free tea. So I didn't have to order a drink/soda. I highly recommend the spicy shrimp tenpura roll. AMAZING and HUGE. Prices range from low to high because there is a section with Special rolls. Never had anything off of this..So far I had the shrimp tenpura roll, Philadelphia roll, creamy tuna, creamy salmon, and the creamy veggie roll. All great choices. They don't give you alot of ginger and i like to eat ginger with each roll so I had to ask for more. The only bad part here is the size of this place. The staff is good.

A day before we met, Joy had expressed vague displeasure over my review of LE COQ RICO (hyped new poultry-oriented French restaurant in Flatiron) but said nothing more. Indeed, her \"vague displeasure\" was so vague she communicated it second-hand via Hope through text message. I was worried and wondered: why did she single out LCR? Was she familiar with the restaurant? Did she think my review of it was inaccurate? Or did she just name it because it happened to be the second most recent review? Did she think just the LCR review was bad or the whole MC3.yelp.com enterprise was going down the hill? Questions, questions. Joy and I (with Hope tagging along) had a chance to hash this out at the \"Great Northern Food Hall.\" (Turns out she had a bad experience at LCR, was condescendingly treated, and I guess thought my review didn't capture it, in addition to generally not being up to par.) Convo quickly turned to other matters.Great Northern Food Fall has been designed as an alternative to Grand Central food staples (Junior's Cheesecake, Oyster Bar, etc.). It specializes in SCANDANVIAN (sp) food, though. A high-risk proposition if you ask me. When is the last time you heard somebody say let's get some SCANDANAVIAN (sp) food, etc.Food is great but logistics of the place are a disaster. (As always, we here aim for structural/organizational approaches to restaurant services rather than the all too easy 'blame the server' approach.) For a Scandanviaan (sp) restaurant, there is a lot of labor squeeze that undercuts the region's social-democratic ethos and reputation. We waited 10 minutes for a hostess, and everything from ordering food to getting plates and water was utter disarray. Great Northern Food Hall seems to be taking a page out of the airport dining playbook with \"iPad menus\" but these were kind of just expensive and pointless without the ability to order directly from them. This place needs to decide if it wants to be a seat-yourself airport type place or wants to run a serious sit-down operation. The current approach, single server plus bad logistics = don't go here if you've got a train to catch and it's busy.We had various \"smorgasbord\" \u00a0(open face sandwich): roast beef for me and Hope, some other thing for Joy. Mix of seasoning is incredibly good, with right tinge of mustard, salt, and other mystery ingredients. Jam-covered sugar-coated pancake dessert also excellent.Was it good? Yes.Would I rather go here than Michael Jordan Steakhouse (Grand Central Location)? No. Because logistics."}, {"star": 1.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "review": "Ordered a chicken cabbage salad at the Almanak - hands down the worst salad I've ever had - and probably the laziest too. tasteless, and had nothing going for it and paid 13$ for that!"}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "review": "This review is for the bar. \u00a0I've been a semi-regular to the bar at the Great Northern Food Hall since its opening, and find it to be a great spot for after-work drinks with some light food added. \u00a0Despite its location inside the ever-busy Grand Central station, Northern Food Hall is actually a good place for a relatively quiet drink in civilized surroundings, with no blasting music and the high ceilings mitigating the general noise level. \u00a0It also never seems to get overcrowded, so in approximately ten visits, I've never not been able to find seats for our group. \u00a0 \u00a0While the surroundings are certainly nice enough, what drew me in first, and keeps me coming back is the food. \u00a0Not a full restaurant, but a few shared dishes, together with a number of small plates, but pretty much every thing is delicious, and well-presented. \u00a0For some reason, the number of dishes on offer seem to have gone down recently, so the food choices are more limited than they used to be. \u00a0On the drink side, while there's a good selection of beers, the choice of wine - especially on the more limited budget side of things - can be a bit limited."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "review": "I went to Scandinavia (Sweden, Denmark, Norway) this year and I really liked the bakeries in Copenhagen in particular. \u00a0My favorite bakeries were Lagkagehuset and Meyers Bageri. \u00a0When I got back to NYC, I found that there's a Meyers Bageri at Grand Central and I got so excited since I really liked their pastries and buns. \u00a0I ordered the kanelsnurrer (cinnamon bun) and frosnapper (sesame and poppy seed pastry). \u00a0They were just as delicious as I remembered!

Located in a very convenient area in Grand Central, it definitely has some hygge vibes. It feels much more organized, airy, visually appealing than a lot of other food halls. A lot of the stalls have the same offerings of fresh breads, pastries, and grab-and-go mini sized salads and parfaits. Food quality seems to be at a higher standard, but you're also paying a bit more for it. It'll most likely be more in the $12-15 range to get a satisfying meal. I passed by the smorresbread (bread with toppings) but they really seemed too small to fill me up, each the size of a large wasa cracker. A fresh sandwich was much more tempting. The pastrami sandwich was really delicious, and I actually got to watch them make it fresh! He sliced the pastrami, loaded on some sauerkraut, slathered aioli on a small whole grain baguette, and handed it to me warm. The baguette was perfectly chewy with no painful roof scratches, and the sandwich was just the right amount of juicy/saucy. I also ordered a chicken salad. Pretty good but I feel like the cabbage was too tough as large chunks. The little nuggets of crispy chicken skin was delightful. Overall seemed a bit pricey for what it was. Lastly a little pastry to go, a frosnapper! A twisted croissant flaky pastry with sesame and poppy seeds. Just barely sweet and so good.

A day before we met, Joy had expressed vague displeasure over my review of LE COQ RICO (hyped new poultry-oriented French restaurant in Flatiron) but said nothing more. Indeed, her \"vague displeasure\" was so vague she communicated it second-hand via Hope through text message. I was worried and wondered: why did she single out LCR? Was she familiar with the restaurant? Did she think my review of it was inaccurate? Or did she just name it because it happened to be the second most recent review? Did she think just the LCR review was bad or the whole MC3.yelp.com enterprise was going down the hill? Questions, questions. Joy and I (with Hope tagging along) had a chance to hash this out at the \"Great Northern Food Hall.\" (Turns out she had a bad experience at LCR, was condescendingly treated, and I guess thought my review didn't capture it, in addition to generally not being up to par.) Convo quickly turned to other matters.Great Northern Food Fall has been designed as an alternative to Grand Central food staples (Junior's Cheesecake, Oyster Bar, etc.). It specializes in SCANDANVIAN (sp) food, though. A high-risk proposition if you ask me. When is the last time you heard somebody say let's get some SCANDANAVIAN (sp) food, etc.Food is great but logistics of the place are a disaster. (As always, we here aim for structural/organizational approaches to restaurant services rather than the all too easy 'blame the server' approach.) For a Scandanviaan (sp) restaurant, there is a lot of labor squeeze that undercuts the region's social-democratic ethos and reputation. We waited 10 minutes for a hostess, and everything from ordering food to getting plates and water was utter disarray. Great Northern Food Hall seems to be taking a page out of the airport dining playbook with \"iPad menus\" but these were kind of just expensive and pointless without the ability to order directly from them. This place needs to decide if it wants to be a seat-yourself airport type place or wants to run a serious sit-down operation. The current approach, single server plus bad logistics = don't go here if you've got a train to catch and it's busy.We had various \"smorgasbord\" \u00a0(open face sandwich): roast beef for me and Hope, some other thing for Joy.

Depending on how hungry you are, 2 or 3 should easily be enough to satisfy you.Other things I've had include soups, chips and guac, chips and pico de gallo, salads, and some of their winter drink specials; none has disappointed when it comes to flavor or portion sizes. I can't think of too many other places in this part of Manhattan where you can walk away with a belly *full* of delicious food having spent maybe $7 or $8."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "review": "Holy tamales!

The tamales are moist and filled to capacity with either Mole, salsa verde, chipotle chicken, bacon mozzarella, rajas con queso. All of them are sooo down home and yummy but do yourself a favor and get the Mole!!!

The blood sausage had an interesting flavor but it wasn't at all bad. The fried meat Korean style was good but the beef was tough and it was nowhere near as spicy as I would expect a Korean-like dish to be. The begodyas, dumplings stuffed with beef and cabbage, were tasty, definitely would order them again.

Then again, it might suit the morning crowd when they order a coffee and an arepa combo for breakfast. Million dollar idea right here, but, nowhere is it advertised as such.Alas, since this place is located in the UES, I suspect that they want to draw customers in first, since it looks new and accessible.

A dichotomy of hearing a satisfying crunch, but tasting soggy insides -think 'YAY', then sudden big time 'MEH'; a smile, then a frown. And the red arepa is supposedly mixed with beets, but it had no flavor. The fillings were somewhat generous, but mediocre as well. I would like some salt, please.The only redeeming food we enjoyed was the spicy green sauce, of which we couldn't get enough of.I almost forgot to add that for some reason, it seemed to be hotter inside the establishment than outside.

Her portion of rice was itty bitty but she was alright with that since she had to head to Queens anyway. The timeliness was pretty fast and efficient.

Honestly, the only things bringing this place down are the terrible customer service and blatant overcharging of everything.We had been at the bar for a couple hours and when the place started to turn for its nighttime crowd (aka a lot of over 40's mixed in with leftover young professionals from HH - at least that was the crowd that Friday night), we decided to leave. When my fianc\u00e9 got the check, the bartender didn't give him an itemized bill, so he asked for one and it literally took her 20 minutes to get one printed out (I don't understand what took her so long and why she wasn't able to just print one out from a POS machine). After seeing the entire check, as we should've the first time, my fianc\u00e9 sees that they charged 20% automatic gratuity (as he expected that they did without stating it on the bill). First off, we were at the bar - not sitting at a table ordering dinner, so it made no sense as to why they would automatically charge tip especially 20% considering the lackluster service we had been given the entire time we were there. To make the experience even more memorable, the manager that was called over by the not-so-intelligent bartender and he was rude, yelled and was very defensive. Pretty sure if you're working in the service industry, you should work on your people skills and learn how to satisfy customers because you wouldn't have a job without us.Another story to add on:They do hookah here which is a little weird because I thought this place was an upscale sports bar, but okay, whatever. So, my friend orders a hookah and asks one of the workers if refills are free. He says yes. Great! My friend ordered 2 more. Nope, not great at all. The bill comes and not only was the price of the hookah higher than what they told us (they said $20, but charged $30), but they charged $10 for refills.

I was expecting a dining/sports bar atmosphere but to my surprise it was a club setting. Shortly after I entered the space and found my group seated in the table service section it was only moments later that I began to be aggressively harassed by a club worker about my lightweight leather blazer. The worker demanded I remove my blazer and check it into their coat check room. He insisted coat check was mandatory and cost $5. I explained to him my blazer was apart of my outfit and I didn't wish to take it off.\u00a0I was comfortable wearing my blazer indoors. I had already gone through an extensive security check at the door so I couldn't understand the intense pressure I was under by this worker for me to check my blazer. The crowd was scarce so it felt like a money scheme to raise funds but their cash flow issues are not my problem. The unprofessional worker continued to rudely follow me around and threaten me with removal from the venue if I did not remove my blazer. I was\u00a0beyond frustrated and highly embarrassed by the treatment I was receiving. \u00a0At the request of my group I checked my blazer and paid the $5. As I sat there I began to witness countless other people wearing their blazers and enjoying themselves as I had intended to do. The manner in which the worker harassed me was so blatant that one of the security guards approached me and offered his personal apology for the way the worker had treated me. The security guard agreed that the worker was way out of line. \u00a0My aunt then approached the worker about all the other people wearing blazers and jackets after he harassed me so badly to check my blazer and he replied to her \"the white people were complaining about checking their blazers so we just let them keep theirs\". So that indicates that my protest and explanation for wanting to wear my blazer didn't mean as much because I'm not \"White\"! A patron is a patron, this is 2017! My civil rights were fought and paid for with blood in the 1960's so how dare Suite 36 impose their \"mandatory\" coat check on me just because I'm not \"white\". I was so disgusted by the treatment I received that didn't spend another dime in Suite 36 and I left knowing I wouldn't go silently. I was treated disrespectfully simply because I am not \"white\", that is \u00a0appalling!!!! I will never return to Suite 36 and encourage others that are \"non white\" to do the same because as the worker said out of his own mouth they have no respect for you or your patronage!!!"}, {"star": 1.0, "date": "2/26/2017", "review": "I will never ever never ever ever ever go to this ratchet place ever again.

I've never experienced such a lack of professionalism in the staff anywhere. This includes the bartenders (with the exception of one), \"security\" and the various people who worked there yet seemed to have no discernible job. I was there recently for a birthday party, in the midst of at least two other large parties. It was still early in the evening (7:45/8 o'clock) when I discovered that my wallet was missing from my purse, which hadn't left my arm. When I told the bartender, he shrugged and walked away. I had to ask another bartender whether anyone had turned it in. After a frantic search, which confirmed my insistence that I hadn't dropped the wallet, I asked to speak with the manager. I was given the run around by a bartender, a bar back and a couple of other people who \"worked\" there. \u00a0After a ridiculous amount of time spent waiting, I stopped to talk to the guy at the door to let him know what was going on and that I was calling the police, since I couldn't document the theft with the manager. He told me that he was the head of security, that he was the one I needed to talk to all along, and that they had been spending the time I was waiting trying to find my wallet (both lies as I later found out). There was a lot of other back and forth that was as close to an argument as a 5'3\" girl (me) can have with 6'7\" man (who was being unprofessionally aggressive). I finally went outside, called the police, and started to call my bank and credit card companies to cancel the cards. In the middle of the process a friend came outside to tell me that the manager - not the security head- was finally available to speak with me. I went back inside and spent a few minutes with her going over my movements, as there is a security camera in the area where I had been standing for most of the evening, and explaining why I was so certain my wallet had been stolen (something she didn't seem to believe). I exited the bar to wait for the police and continue cancelling my credit cards, when I learned that in the time that I had been put off and mistreated by the Suite 36 staff (about 1.5 hours at this point), $1800 had been charged to one of my credit cards!!!Needing now to make certain the manager understood that my wallet truly had been stolen, I went back inside and asked to speak with the manager again. The people at the door and the \"other\" staff including the \"head of security\" at this point didn't just put me off, they were hostile and threatening as I waited for the manager. More than two hours after I discovered the theft of my wallet, I finally left that despicable place, minus my wallet, plus more aggravation than anyone deserves, and with an assurance that the manager would look over the security tapes. Sure. As nice as she actually was, given the lack of professionalism at that place, I'm not holding my breath for a call.Additionally, I found out on the cab ride home that my friend had been massively over charged on his bill: $130 for 5 drinks. And at least two of them were purchased during happy hour when all drinks were still $6. When my friend questioned the bill, he was told that he \"had been given doubles.\" Without ordering them. And even with that pathetic attempt at a justification, the bill still didn't add up.So, if you want the worst all-around service you're likely to encounter in the city, and possibly to be over-charged on your bill, by all means visit this place.

Any business owner who cares about how there operation is run will take suggestions and negative posts and try there best to resolve them and attempt to ensure that the issue never occurs again. With that said I visited this establishment recently and wish our group had went else where. We visited suite 36 at night so this is when it was completely turned into a lounge, which is what we were there for. The patrons at Suite 36 were really nice and diverse and aged between 21-40. Our issue that night was the service and it was at the front. Its unfortunate suite 36 is such a nice place they have good people visiting but they higher ghetto people for the front. The bouncer and the little guy running the front, were the two most disrespectful people i have ever encountered while entering this type of establishment. They caused issues and talked down to the people in the line as if we were in the projects fighting. As a former bouncer, i would say that is the absolute worse way you can run a door, your job isn't difficult so don't act like your doing brain surgery and get a power trip. You check IDs allow people in to enter safety and DE-ESCALATE issues that occur, your job isn't to create them! These two employees in the front were acting extremely unprofessional and completely turned us all off to this place in the future. I don't understand how you expect to receive repeat customers by treating them like crap before they even enter the door. In my opinion if you want to clean up your front end, get rid of the little guy in the front who has a napoleon complex and replace him with a friendly female and definitely get rid of your bouncer and replace him with someone nwho treats people with respect and is a gentleman. As I had learned from experience, one day your bouncer will upset the wrong person and will cause a fight at the front door with one of your patrons and its going to be a mess and you can kiss all the money goodbye that you should have made that day because you have a buffoon for a bouncer."}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "10/15/2016", "review": "My friend was having happy hour here on Thursday evening and told me to swing by.

None of that. They even forgot that the room was ready even I was waiting at the lobby for a couple of hours. I wasn't offered a better room and they tried to send me to a room without kitchen when I had reserved a full kitchen room, which I rejected. For the rest, front desk people were nice and saluted me when I walked in and out every day.Breakfast was good and had varied options. They have an omelette bar where you can order or serve yourself fruit, eggs, bacon, yogurt, cereal, etc. However, Hyatt provides more seating and even more options at other locations.The room was ok and spacious considering NY standards. A plus was that I wasn't bothered by outside noises, which was good considering that a huge construction was taking place next door.

Perfect if you have luggage you don't want to carry too far.2) prices for a stay from Wed-Fri were beyond reasonable. Hotels.com got me in for about $150/night - I'll take it!3) Hyatt is a name I know. No it's not the fanciest of all hotels, but it's a name I trust.The only complaint about my stay here was that there were only 2 elevators. They did move at lightning speed though, but for a 30 floor (right around there?) building, I would have liked a couple more. But I know space is hard to come by in New York City, so I understand. Our room was fairly small compared to other hotels I've visited, but again, for the City - this is normal. We shared 1 large comfy King bed, had a desk, a good sized tv, refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker - all of the necessities. The bathroom was actually pretty big and spacious with a nice stand-up shower. Service was remarkable from beginning to end. We got to NYC much earlier than the 3pm check-in and were able to leave our luggage while we walked around for a bit. We had just enough time to eat brunch until they called at about 11 or 12 letting us know that our room was ready if we wanted to check-in - Loved this. All of the staff we came in contact with whether they were at the front desk or in passing in the elevator were super friendly and hospitable. The free hot breakfast was delicious - eggs, sausage, pancakes, fruit and cereal, breads, even an omelette station.

I see the vision they have for the hotel, but they opened WAY too soon and this place is NOT ready for the public yet. It is beyond obvious that they opened before they were ready, and this was probably fueled by the need to recoup the high costs of construction.The room itself: pretty good. Everything was so clean, they have a lot of amenities in the kitchen. One thing I thought was odd was that everything was relatively high-tech (every lamp, outlet, etc. has a USB slot or two, super nice) but then the bedside clock is a crappy little radio clock. Kinda weird, since the rest of the room was at a caliber that made me expect that there'd be a nice speaker clock or something, but oh well. Another odd thing was the lack of a large trash can-- for a place that touts itself on having a pretty full kitchen, there is nowhere to throw away things used in the process. It's all in the details.Everything else: kinda yikes! There are parts of this building that are legitimately dangerous. Staff recommend you go to the terrace on the 11th floor and the nice open area on the rooftop on the 30th-something floor, but there are construction materials everywhere and loose tiles abound! It was literally unstable to walk on. They are in the middle of getting their act together and it's not a cute look. If the rooms were outrageously discounted during this intermediary period, I would understand, but they were full price. Not cool. At least the views from the rooftop are cool, but I dunno.Food: In the evening, the guy at the bar is SUPER nice and is doing all the work himself. Running the bar, rushing to the kitchen to make food if you order it, taking care of cleaning. It's a one man show, and he's good at it. Luckily it wasn't too busy so I hope that if it picks up they hire someone else to help him. In the morning, their free continental breakfast is pretty good, and they even make you little omelettes. However, I don't recommend waiting for them because they take a lot of time to come out and they're absurdly tiny.At least the staff were really kind and security was great. Part of me was happy that they locked the doors to the lobby and you had to flash your card to get in past midnight, but part of me was also drunk and really just wanted to get to my god damn room, you know?

They are usually soft and fresh, although sometimes a little light on the sugar glaze. The jelly munchkin was stale, as I don't think it's very popular. I got it a couple times and they were always stale and had minimal jelly inside. \u00a0The bagels have been consistently fresh. They are always soft on the inside and a slightly crisp and bite on the outside. I do find it odd that whenever I order a lot of munchkins and donuts, they refuse to give it in a box. They always prefer a paper bag, which is kind of annoying because I don't want my regular sized donuts squished in a bag, or to have paper stuck on them.

Minus the front door sign, there has been no major renovations as the staff, menu, and even the Chinese name (\u5229\u82d1\u98df\u574a) is still the same.For people who have frequented Sunway over the years, know that all the other elements are still in place. The parking is awful, despite people parking for pickup on Prince almost at all hours. The smoke and smell from across the street Fat Ni BBQ (yelp.com/biz/fat-ni-bbq-\u2026) still permeates the front door. And they're still open super late at night (yay!).Service has always been subpar, but it's adequate for what the place is. The one thing that keeps this late night cafe from stardom is the food. It's all just decent, but not much stands out. Traditionally, this is not all that different from a HK Style Cafe, which is essentially the American diner equivalent of Chinese eateries. In addition to the lackluster food choices, it's not exactly cheap to eat here. Dim Sum is overpriced and a good number of their items are in the $12+ range. For less gourmet pricing, aim for most noodles or over rice dishes. And lastly, forget the credit card, it's cash only here.I would also consider avoiding the bubble tea, as most of it is too powdery for my liking. They are the only spot in Flushing to serve Dim Sum at night but very little of it is fresh (if at all).

Responsible prices and decent service. Good attitude but can forget things easily and not the most attentive but they do try. Owner is usually there and bathrooms are pretty clean. The interior is organized and a pretty casual and relaxing atmosphere. The only struggle sometimes is that they only take cash. There is an ATM at the door of the store but it takes a bit of interest. There are also a few different banks in a couple blocks down. A few different bus stops and the 7 train at walking distance, so it's pretty convenient. Not hard to find because it's just right at the corner of the street. Not the best quality/ingredients or the most authentic dishes but it's decent. I don't usually recommend the scallion pancake or the turnip cake though. If you really have a craving, I'd said sure go for it it's enough to somewhat satisfy that craving.

For entrees they got the black cod which was pretty good. I tried it and it was perfectly seasoned and flaky but not overly cooked. I opted for the steak and rice. That tasted good too but it was nothing overly amazing. If I had to choose again I would go with the cod. As for dessert the carrot cake is a must. It was just added to the menu and I could see why. I usually don't like desserts because they're usually too sweet but the cake tasted perfect. Now for the negatives:When I was eating the steak I found a hair in it. However the staff was really apologetic about it and replaced my meal and even comped it. I thought that situation was handled very well.Another con was that service was kind of slow. It took us a long time from our 2nd course to get our dessert. The waiter even brought our check to us mistakenly thinking we had already gotten our dessert. They are however very friendly.Overall I'm not sure how I feel about the place. The food was good but sometimes the service was lacking.

Tuesday April 10th, I went to the sushi bar at Nobu. I ordered and this Asian American man made my Sushi rolls. Thankfully he made them and not the other man accompanying him making the sushi. I was horrified at the other man making sushi next to him. What first made me watch the guy, was that when he knelt down to take a drink from his personal plastic thermos (the refillable one you take to the gym or everywhere with you throughout the day).It was a red flag for me because when he touched his plastic thermos he did it with his dirty fishy gloves and then went back to making sushi with the same gloves. Then I thought... that's his personal water bottle and I'm sure it's not wiped down before placing it under the bar. Whatever is on his bottle is now on his gloves and vis versa. I'm thinking of cross contamination on so many levels at this point but no, it gets worse. The orders that were coming in, he was touching the thermal paper with fish-blood gloves. He then dipped it into a container of water and stuck the orders to the top of the glass refrigeration station encapsulating the fish supply at the bar. He then went back to making sushi with the same gloves. \u200d \u00a0My thought was,\"If he's doing that now, that means he's been dipping his receipts with fishy gloves into that same container of water all night.\" But wait, there's more.....About 5-6 mins later I then noticed both thumbs of his gloves completely break apart as he's making rolls and with bare thumbs and sweaty hands, continuing making sushi!!!! I know what your hands get like when they sweat in latex gloves.... if anyone doesn't know what it's like, it's like your hands after you've been in hot yoga for an hour on an elliptical. It gets funky in there and then this guy touches raw food!? Omg... \u00a0He kept making sushi without replacing his gloves. After continuing to make sushi with half bare hands and cross contaminating receipts, his water bottle and the damn food he was making, I decided to notify someone. I told my waitress to tell this guy to replace his gloves and that it was f***ing disgusting what he was doing.The guy replaced his gloves but not before dipping his hands into some sort of powder. I am unsure if it was flour, baby powder or talcum powder but whatever type of powder, it tells me that he had probably done this before he put on the original gloves that had deteriorated. This means customers were not only getting cross-contamination from fish but residue of some hand sweat slurry of powder and whatever else he had on his hands as he made their food.The only reason why I would go back is to order a glass of whiskey so I can throw it onto his hands so I know they're somewhat sterile.

Nobu makes their rolls so basic yet they're the best rolls you'll ever have... the quality of the fish is unprecedented.The rock shrimp is a standard at any Japanese/Sushi restaurant, they out-do themselves through the presentation. The chili-garlic sauce/olive oil are perfectly done. The crispy rice is something you cannot replicate at home, it is served at the perfect temperature and everything on the plate complement each other perfectly. The baby artichoke salad is the best/most underrated starter on the menu, for sure. It's refreshing, not that filling, but enough for you to get exactly what you want out of a first/second course. The tacos are the best things on the menu but I recommend them to be ordered last, the taste is slightly overwhelming that you don't want to mix it with the other plates in front of you. The taste is super rich.For drinks, the grapefruit martini looks great but tastes better.

The mozzarella and tomato sauce had great flavor, with a hint of oregano coming through. The meatballs were light and flavorful, not at all dense - just the right amount of bread crumbs to bind them, more chicken than filler. The star of this sandwich is the bread - a beautifully crusty, toasted, and delicious seeded bread that instantly took me back to my childhood in New York. When the flavor of something can transport you back in time, that's a pretty great bite. The only thing I'd suggest is to tuck another meatball or two into the sub, to get some meatball flavor in every bite.The setting is quite nice for a pizzeria - definitely bigger than I expected - and the guy who made my sub was a really cool and nice guy. The other staffer could learn a thing or two from him, as she was stand-offish to the point of being rude, not the best way to treat your guests.

And apparently, it is the Roman equivalent of that, made with risotto and mozzarella v. the beef ragu and peas that typify the classic Sicilian (Arancini) version. Though I appreciated that these ($4 nets you two) were fried to a perfect, greaseless crisp, they tasted like they needed a bit more seasoning. \u00a0I wouldn't've minded a side of kicked up marinara for dipping.Pizza with Sausage & Mushrooms, among the 'Red Pie' selections: \u00a0Liked this a lot, though I'd say the mushroom flavor dominated v. the other ingredients, including sausage.Pizza with Sausage & Broccoli Rabe, among the 'White Pie' selections: \u00a0Not usually a fan of white pizza, but wound up enjoying this one too, especially the broccoli rabe, which unlike at many places, was not cooked to death, and maintained a crisp-tender bite and vivid green color. \u00a0Also appreciated its pop of bitterness , which definitely dominated over the far more subtle sausage.Margherita: \u00a0What with me hailing from the Dairy State and all, am probably fonder than most when it comes to cheese. \u00a0But I draw the line when it covers the ENTIRE surface area of my pizza, as it did in this case. \u00a0And the tomato sauce just wasn't assertive enough to compete in terms of adding any other flavor. I intensely disliked this. \u00a0Interestingly too, the counter person asked us whether we wanted basil or not on our Margherita. \u00a0Isn't that a given? \u00a0Asking for a friend. Okay, actually I want to know.A Word about the Crust: It's thin and light, with some crispness to it and also a bit of chew. \u00a0On our visit at least, it was pliable enough to be folded. \u00a0I was into it, but one 4-slice pie may not be enough if you're really hungry.A Word about the Space: \u00a0It's smaller than I imagined, with a couple big, communal-style tables and maybe a handful of smaller ones, plus some high round tables with backless stools.Back to that disappointing Margherita: \u00a0I consider this the yardstick by which I measure artisanal pizza joints, and I think this counts as one in spite of its fast-casual concept, and it was just not worth the calories imho. \u00a0I also hold any Danny Meyer enterprise to a higher standard than I do some Joe Schmo-operated spot. \u00a0So alas, am rounding my overall 3.5 experience down to a 3."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "review": "I like the promptness and the ease of the experience here.

I can barely buy a frozen pizza at Whole Foods for that same price. There's nothing pretentious about this place; you just order at the counter and they'll bring the food out when its ready.2.

The food is really solid. The pizzas are thin crust, personal sized, and cut into 4 slices, so perfect for sharing with small groups or couples. The Brussels sprouts cacio e pepe was surprisingly light and tangy for a white-crust pizza, and the sausage (red sauce) had the most tender little mushrooms. We also tried a side of the broccoli rabe (would have been better if it was hot) and the croquettes, both of which were good but not mind blowing.4. The soft serve. For the love of god, please get the fior de latte soft serve. I don't care if it's 10 degrees outside, this is the one can't-miss item at Martina. And while you're at it, get it with the sea salt, olive oil, and candied hazelnuts. The soft serve itself is so thick and creamy, with a flavor that blows away every vanilla I've ever had.

The pizzas are personal size, a small/good 15inches round pie, pretty thin. If you are hungry, you definitely need two. Prior pizza we shared a side of salad with pecorino cheese, and an order of suppl\u00ec, which come with two rice balls typical from Roma with an inside heart of melted cheese. Delicious!Overall was a nice experience, but I feel it's a place more for lunch or weekend snacks. Nice discovery anyway!"}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "review": "The pizzas are great!

It is a clean and elegant, but unpretentious space.Starters: the suppli are tangy, creamy, tomato-based, and so good. The chicken meatballs are also really juicy and the marinara on top is extremely good (not gravy-like, more fresh, bright tomato). I can taste real parmesano/romano on top.Pizza: the pizzas are small, I would say one pizza would satisfy the average person but I would also get an extra pizza or a few starters to share if you're two people and definitely at the very least if you're four. We loved all the pizzas we tried, margherita, broccoli rabe/sausage, brussels sprouts, and four cheese. The four cheese was a little stinky (in a good way) for me, but my mom (she likes stinky) loved it. The pies are thinner than neopolitan but thicker than cracker-style. A really good thickness that I think differentiates itself from other popular places in the area.For dessert we ordered affogato, but were given the vanilla soft serve gelato with cherries instead. Although I really wanted to try the affogato, and I am sure had I asked they would have given us our correct order, I was in a pleasant carb coma and *settled* for what we received. It was definitely the thickest soft serve I ever had, not too sweet, really good. I would have loved to try it with nuts and olive oil. Next time!Overall I say this is a great place and I am definitely coming back. Having tried many of the *top* pizzerias in the city, I know what I like and rarely add to my rotation of Rubirosa (best thin pie), Joe's (best slice), and Ribalta (best grandma pie), however, this is definitely making it in."}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "review": "this is the sister to Marta and it's pretty good for a quick pie. you get the quality of Marta without the frills of eating at a nice restaurant. low key and good!"}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "review": "Really cool unpretentious pizza joint: big lay out, you order at the bar from the menu or make your own pizza, you pay, are given a number, you choose a table and then they bring you your items!

They were like arancini, I'm not exactly sure if there's a difference or if there's more than one name for this appetizer but either way, they were good. They weren't greasy or dry, which is usually what can make these not taste great, but the crisp was just right. Then we had our two pizzas which we shared. One was the mushroom pizza, with onions, thyme, and fontina. The other pizza was a \"my margherita\" (which is a regular Margherita with your choice of toppings), and we got the mushrooms and truffle oil. Although the two pizzas both had mushrooms, they were quite different. Equally good, and after a break I could've even split a third pizza. We had wine with dinner, and although the drink options are very limited, it actually didn't taste bad for a house wine at all.

Martha is a restaurant a bit too fancy for me if I just want to grub a pizza and spend some time out. Martina is just perfect: the pizza is super thin, not huge but a small version which is perfect size and you can pair it with amazing suppli' which are the rice balls with mozzarella inside, delicious! The price is very good and you can order and sit casually in the airy and generous tables area finally a pizza place with several dine in tables! The tip is included which is also very nice for once.

When it comes to a solid burger at good value, I can't think of anywhere else in America (yes, in my view In-N-Out is not even close). Can this fast-casual model, thought, be replicated with any other food? Well, the USHG certainly seems to think they can do the same (and have the same level of success) with pizzas, another American favorite. Martina, which opened earlier this year in East Village, received plenty of hype for potentially being the next big thing. When I showed up on a Friday evening with my wife Jun, we were greeted by an open kitchen with the staffs making dough constantly. It took us less than 10 minutes to get everything after I placed an order. Sounds familiar right? Except, the pizzas at Martina could use a little bit of magic the same way Shack Burger has. In terms of value proposition, Martina is fantastic. Our mushroom pie with onion and fontina came at $9, and sausage pie with mushrooms and pecorino came at $11. We also liked the fact that both pies came in thin crust so that we don't have to overstuff ourselves with unnecessary carbs. On the other hand, everything else about the pizza made us inevitably compare the pies to what we had tasted at the more formal Danny Meyer pizzeria Marta in Midtown. We both felt that the overall flavor of both pies didn't have the same punch that led us to enjoy each slice with glee at the sister restaurant, and found ourselves adding chili oil generously to help the spicy kick get us through the pies with more ease. Of the two, I thought the sausage one was slightly better thanks to the red sauce; still, we both ended up dipping the leftovers crust to the sauce of chicken meatball we had ordered as an appetizer (which wasn't bad, but not memorable either, as was the case with risotto croquettes). Martina doesn't take reservations and the dining space got filled up pretty quickly, so avoid prime times if possible. There are a couple of Italian cocktail and wine options to complement your meal but you wouldn't expect to have a satisfying glass of sangiovese at a fast-casual joint like this, right? For a quick 30-minute bite before going back to work or classroom, Martina deserves consideration for a nice place to stop by. If you are a pizza connoisseur who wants to have a couple of satisfying pies, I'm not sure Martina is the right place. On the other hand, I would have no issue saying that Shake Shack works every time you are in for a nice burger to fill up your belly."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "review": "Excellent pizza at Marta's little sister spot. We got the salame and the brussels sprouts / cacio e pepe, both of which we really liked, but the latter definitely stood out as more differentiated from what you can get elsewhere in the city. We also got an order of suppli to start, which were very good, and a half meatball sub, because it just looked so beautiful that I had to try it. The bread is as good as it looks, and the meatballs were good, but I thought the sauce was a little too herby, and the construction was a little off -- the meatballs didn't really fit in the bread all that well, and it was hard to get good bites of both combined.That said, the pizza was great and pretty well priced."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "review": "Noticed Martina a couple of months ago walking by. \u00a0Looked interesting and made a mental note to come back.

If you want good food at a good price this is it. We had the suppli-risotto croquettes, a margherita pizza with sausage, spicy salami, and egg as well as the Brussels sprouts and cacio pepe pizza. Everything was well portioned and delicious. If you see squeeze bottles of an orange substance you must try it.

I must have read 30,000 articles hyping this place. I thought the founder of Shake Shack was carrying the ball here but instead my friend YOU ARE FUMBLING IT. \u00a0Given the amount of money you made taking Shake Shack public I guess I had very expectations. Maybe hire delivery people and staff that could be potentially dressed like a real life Mario and Luigi. \u00a0Instead of hiring a hipster with a mustache, gather a gang of border jumpers to work the back of the joint. \u00a02) \u00a0buy a few green cards for not one, but three to four Italian grandmothers. Ship them in from Italy, let them keep the mustache, fish nets but motivate them to create that kitchen magic. \u00a0Don't hire a friendly staff, keep it rough, focus on the food and large portion sizes. This is Italian food after all. Remember if a guy with a gold chain on and the IROC-Z parked out in front (blasting freestyle / \u00a0with a Staten Island based NY Drivers license) wouldn't approve you are NOT doing it right. Now that I feel a little bit better let me continue with my rant. So after starving myself for four hours prior and eagerly waiting for delivery I was beyond disappointed. The pizza showed up in a funky box, it was so thin and measly portioned (looked like a weak appetizer at kitchen to farm type of restaurant). All in I ordered two personal pan pizzas, one chicken meatball (under-cooked, tiny, cold i.e. #disgraceful). All in, the meal cost around $41 bucks with tip. Also my old lady (aka my gf) ordered a salad which showed up in a mini bowl (looked like a 3 yo size kid's portion). She also shared my disappointment and isn't even from America, let alone born in Brooklyn. When she's asking me to go Sbarro after ordering this well that's when I know I had to Yelp about it. If Joe's on 14th is the Harambe of NYC pizza, well let's just say Martina is the Bill DeBlasio of NYC Italian cuisine. This place sucks (compared to the hype) and the portion size is laughable. I rather go to the $1 pizza place on sixth avenue and 26th (knowing that while sober it truly does taste like cardboard) vs. \u00a0sitting here at home for over an hour and waiting to be robbed of $40 bucks without a gun. Tonight reminded me of a startling trend here in NYC. The media hyping praise on restaurants \u00a0that are not worthy of a GrubHub delivery let alone \"hottest resty\" type article. Then again these same media outlets also refuse to publish the truth during election season (but that's another matter). \u00a0In fact, Danny Meyer needs to wake up. His no tip policy proved disastrous, so shame on me for not realizing he's on a cold streak lately, one that likely would prove colder vs. the horrendous pizza they delivered to me tonight."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "review": "Great spot for a quick bite. \u00a0The chicken meatball was tender, in a very good tomato sauce. \u00a0I wish they had the chicken meatball sub with melted mozzarella on the menu.

I am also a big of Motorino. The pizzas are similar gourmet thin style pizzas except smaller and more personal sized. The restaurant is a fast casual type, but they made the interior very welcoming so that you want to sit down and enjoy your meal. The restaurant is quite spacious with plenty of tables. I have tried the Capricciosa (artichokes, ham, mushrooms, black olives, mozzarella & egg) and the Brussel Sprouts Cacio e Pepe. The crust was really thin and crispy, but still had enough chew. I thought the flavors of the Capricciosa were great. The best part was the egg. Be care of the olives, some of them still have pits. The Brussel Sprouts one wasn't as good as the Capricciosa, but still a delicious gourmet white pizza. There were a lot of sprouts on the pizza. It had somewhat of a sour taste and didn't remind me too much of Cacio e Pepe. They are not skimpy on the toppings for any of their pizzas.On the table they have freshly ground black pepper which you grind yourself, this chili flake mix, and chili oil if you want more spice to your pizza. The chili oil is great! I recommend adding that on your pizza. Overall, really great quality gourmet pizzas without the hassle or wait of a normal sit-down restaurant.2/18 Update:They got rid of their incredibly delicious Capricciosa, but they now have an amazing lunch special. $10 for any pizza and a starter. This is probably one of the best lunch specials I've seen to date, since their pizzas are more on the gourmet side. I wish they kept the Capricciosa, but I tried their Sausage pizza and it was just as delicious. Their fried risotto croquettes stuffed with mozzarella is quite heavy and not as tasty as regular mozzarella sticks.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get to the theater soon enough and didn't purchase the ticket that includes the pie.

You come before curtains, and they seat you in the same area that you'll be sitting at for the show itself, although maybe not the exact seats. You can order a drink with your pie. The pie is pretty good; mine was the chicken. Their website brags that the pies are from a former White House chef.

The venue is set up to look like Harrington's, with a counter and the dining rows and everything. The actors perform around the audience, so you're constantly turning and looking at what's going on.

The same building also houses a nursery school, among other things.The front desk in the center of the lobby has a check-in clipboard for visitors as well as some publications. The right wall has glass cases of memorabilia on display and for sale and a corner office that serves as the box office. The opposite wall has a staircase to the upper mezzanine, as well as another corner room that serves as both bar and coat check. After I picked up my ticket, I was able to use the men's room upstairs (two sinks, two toilets, and two urinals). The lobby employees dressed as pie-shop workers are pretty friendly: not sure if they were in character or just being cordial.The Sweeney Todd seating arrangement consists of five (six?) wooden tables & benches (seating 12 each) positioned perpendicular to the stage, and 3-4 rows of tiered upper and lower mezzanine seats in the back of the room. I was fortunate enough to score a seat at one of the benches, and my neighbors and I were instructed to keep the tabletops clear at all times because \"anything could happen\". As you have probably heard, the actors move all around the room during the course of the show, even appearing in the balcony a few times. Regardless of where your seat is, you'll need to turn your head to see all of the action. Despite being closer to the action, I confess that I found the table seating extremely awkward: I spent the entire show with my torso twisted 45 - 90 degrees and trying to avoid direct eye contact with the girl sitting across the table from me. People sitting at the tables closest to the front will be the primary and most obvious targets of audience participation, e.g. when I saw the show, Mr. Todd screamed at an audience member in the front to move so that he could sit the beggar woman down and properly fake-murder her. This and two other instances were the only I observed where a direct response from an audience member was required. If you get serenaded by the beggar woman or Mr. Todd himself, you can for the most part just enjoy the eye contact without having to do much else.To give you an idea of how close the actors get to the audience: I got to see Anthony's boots up close and feel the fabric of Johanna's dress (not by choice) while they were at my table.The pit is a 3-man group of clarinetist, violinist, and pianist (who also blows the tin whistle when a character is murdered).The lobby is just barely large enough to contain the entire audience during the 15-minute intermission, so I recommend walking around the block (away from the smokers and construction) instead of slowly suffocating inside. I didn't have to pee during intermission, so I can only guess how horrible the lines for the restrooms must have been.Interestingly, programs (non-Playbills) are placed on tables the lobby at the end of the performance, rather than given out before the performance.I was fortunate enough to see most of the original company (minus Brad Oscar). Most of the principals in the current cast will be departing the show later this month, starting with Norm Lewis on 8/14, so if you still want a chance to be within spitting distance of any of them while they're still together you have about 2 weeks before the cast gets reshuffled."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2017", "review": "This is a hidden gem of a theatre.

If you like long-form improv (or have never watched it live), you need to see TJ&D. Watching their creative wheels spin live is a thing to behold. There's a Radiolab podcast episode about the show that explains a lot of what goes behind each performance (each one is completely different. Trust them, it's all made up!).I've also seen Daniel Kitson perform standup here, and that was one of the most unique \"sets\" ever. It was more like non-stop storytelling with hilarious tangents, but he quickly became one of my favorite comedians that night.Last but not least, they're currently showing Every Brilliant Thing, which is almost beyond words.

We didn't order any food, but the menu look great for appetizers.We easily got a nice cozy spot at a back table a little after 9pm on a Saturday, but there was also a decent amount of seating available at the bar if you didn't want table service. The decor is really welcoming and intimate too. Music was a *little* loud, but nothing I would consider obnoxious and the general crowd in the bar was leisurely, not \"let's get wasted and be obnoxious\". We both order two cocktails which were delicious and perfectly mixed, not just liquor dumped with a mixer. We each also had a glass of wine too--the Pinot Grigio was good and my friend's Prosecco was served in the right kind of flute!Other than the ambiance and good drinks, I cannot say enough good things about the staff at this place. Our waitress was beyond sweet and accommodating, she even gave me a small tasting of the Prosecco before I order the wine to see if it was too sweet for me.

So maybe it is better at other times.Parking is an issue. The parking in front of the hotel is only one hour. There is a lot down the street that is affordable but sketchy. There were many broken down cars, not many nice ones, and they hold your key, which made us nervous, but was fine.Our main issues were with check-in. On a friend's recommendation, we called and requested a room on the back side of the hotel one week prior to our stay. It is near the train and noisy (but you're in the city so no big deal). We called the morning of to remind them of this and they told us it wouldn't be available. Understandable, but annoying. I also asked if we could check in early, around 1, and were told that wouldn't be a problem. We arrived around 5 (four hours later) and our room still was not ready. We were told a housekeeper had called in. Our friend, who stayed in the hotel the week prior had the exact same issue. Nothing was offered to us, thought they were a bit apologetic.

This is almost a \"hole in the wall\" place, except the inside decor is decent. Anyway, that doesn't matter, what really matters is how tasty the sushi is. We ordered shrimp shumai, a dragon roll, an explosion roll, a New York roll and a haluhai (sp?) roll. The haluhai roll is not on the menu, but listed as a special on the white board. Everything was really delicious and I couldn't help but binge. I think my favorite was the haluhai roll - it had this shredded crab on top and was hot in the middle. It was just very different from anything I've had before. The service is also quick. We were seated immediately and got our food soon after we ordered. The prices are pretty average - it's not dirt cheap, but certainly not too expensive as far as sushi goes. The only thing I didn't like is that the lighting made it very difficult for me to read the menu. It might just be something with my eyes, I don't know, but it took me awhile to decide just because I had trouble seeing. As I said, everything was delicious and the service was quick so it's definitely worth a least a try.

I offered to come back by to show them and when I did they referred me to someone at sushi bar (don't know if he was owner or sushi chef) but despite showing him the brown bits (literally a brown blood-clot-like-thread), clumpiness, and discoloration his only solution was next time I come in he will give me curry.Not sure why I could'nt get curry now (in place of what I paid for) but my response was mainly that I didn't feel safe eating the uni and that I was not going to eat it and get sick just to prove that it is indeed safe/not safe...he basically told me to fuck off (after asking me if I was Japanese/Chinese).So I am out the money for the curry and the tip and I bet that damn future curry.Two stars for the hungry tears rolling down my eyes that I can probably never eat here again without going on a tirade about the uni, the curry, and the fact that I am writing a stupid yelp review.Woe is me.See pics attached.

I ordered the combo that was crunchy tuna, spicy salmon, and spicy yellowfin tuna. OMGGGGG the yellowfin tuna roll was probably one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had! The spicy salmon was delicious, and the crunchy tuna was good too. It was a lot of food and unfortunately I wasn't able to eat it all.I chose this place because others had mentioned the free sake. This is not something they publicize at the restaurant, and the menu actually lists pricing for the sake. I was really in the mood for it anyway, so I ordered hot sake. The other couple we were with wanted to order sake as well, so he told the waitress to put the next one on his tab. This is when she said she didn't have to do that because sake was free.

I'd never done this before but I kindly told the server that I had made a mistake, I tried it but really did not like it because the meat was tough and I couldn't eat it. I asked it be taken off the bill since I had only had one bite. She at first said she couldn't take it off the bill but I could swap for something else. I ordered something else and the woman returned 2 min later with the plate I had given back and said her manager said that I could not change it out. We asked to speak to the manager and she said he just left. (weird?) I explained that I had literally only taken a bite, it didn't taste good the meat was really dry and I didn't want to pay for something I couldn't eat.

Plus, I found a parking spot on the next block, this place looked interesting and I did a quick yelp and was impressed about what I read. Once one walks into this business, you're greeted with an open white space (I wish I could have described more succinctly, but I digress). I was greeted by a gentleman behind the counter who was patient as I surveyed the menu for something to jump out to me. Let me stop right here real quick. I've had a couple of bad experiences with halal food karts in the city (more specifically, the ones in the are of MSG by my office), and I've had this standing rule in which i never try a new halal spots chicken first. If you want to get into my heart (by way of stomach of course), one must be able to make a good lamb (gyro, platter, etc). Let's just say when i saw their menu, my little chicken rule when out of the window. Hell, i was about to order two meals it intrigued me so. In any case, i ordered the mixed platter (chicken and lamb for you folks not keeping up) with brown rice. I asked my server if i could get every sauce (hot, green [really hot], bbq, tahini and white? Lol can't remember the last one) and he said sure. So you know that's what i was going to do. Unfortunately, i had to get this meal back home before partaking. It was the longest hour drive of my life.The food they put in the container is hefty. Basically more than enough for two people, or two servings (as was the case for me). First bite impressions? The Halal Spot has earned the positive reputation it has secured on yelp. Talk about flavor? I was pleasantly surprised. In addition, the salad complimented the spice of the hot and green sauce. The brown rice was just wow. Every bite i took i had to question whether or not it was really brown rice. The halal spot is a solid 4.5 and i will be returning.

The rice, also unfamiliar to me, is long and thin and sauteed in spices, including perhaps cloves, but subtly so. Apparently the rice here is done in Afghani style. I'm looking forward to trying other dishes. The owner told me they are going to keep introducing more dishes."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2017", "review": "Wow!!

I definitely wanted a plate but couldn't decide between lamb or chicken, so I got combination of both with brown rice and lots of white sauce! I have eaten tons of halal type of chicken/lamb with rice dishes but this was hands down the best ever! The food was fresh and tasty, unlike everywhere else the lamb was not salty at all, just perfect! Also their spices selection was just perfect. Their brown rice is really really good must try it! Normally after eating this type of food you would feel stuffed and bloated but I felt great like I would have eaten a home cooked meal! They also make zinger, cheese, wild Alaskan salmon and veggie burgers!! You can actually taste the difference in their food which is a big plus!

My dad would take me here since I was 12 and I recently started coming back again after many years, and it is just as good as ever. Fantastic steaks/meats and pretty inexpensive. Their meats are absolutely fantastic- the churrasco (skirt steak) and pollo combo is delicious, and very reasonably priced. The meats come to your table sizzling on a metal plate, making your mouth water. The portions are very large for the price. The meat combos also come with arroz, frijoles, and pl\u00e1tanos, so you get your veggies in, jaja. Absolutely everything is delicious. My family is from Argentina, the land of good meat, and everybody agrees this is the best steak from any non-Argentinian restaurant. The meat is so good that my father for many years refused to even go back to the Argentinian restaurant because he claimed this meat was such a better deal. It really is tasty. Even before the meat comes out, the bread you are given is incredible, by FAR my favorite bread out of any restaurant in the city. Generally speaking, the bread restaurants give you tends to be bland and boring. Not this bread. It's a very flat, Cubano style bread with melted butter on it, completely different than the usual bread you are given to snack on. Put some steak sauce on it and you will get a delicious combo. I guarantee you that you will finish this basket of bread quickly. \u00a0They also have a really extensive drink menu, with like 100+ different cocktails and tragos, and they all sound delicious. Every drink I've ordered is always super strong, which is generally a good thing for an alcoholic like me. Service is also very good and attentive. I speak Spanish but I imagine English speakers would have no problem.I definitely recommend everybody check El Conde out. It's in a neighborhood filled with bars and restaurants and lots to do, so it's not out of the way.

Finally when we inside there was a few people but most of the place was empty. The place was very spacious tables and chairs all around. The waitress gave us a place to sit the minute we sat down the table was unbalanced and if you lean on it to much could of easily flipped. The waitress (guy) comes to the table maybe 3 minutes after we sat down and ask if we ready to order. Told him we needed a minute but at the same time order drinks as we wait for the food.The food was good but the presentation was bad. The mango mojitos were incredibly bad. They were not even made the right way. Very sugary at the bottom of the cup and the mint leaf were blended with the mango. The bar area was tiny small but cute. The music would stop and then the same songs will repeat. One of the things that I did not like is while we were eating a guy starts to sweep up the place I guess they were getting ready to close I'm a bit but he starts sweeping the tables around us. All that dust was in the air and it's very unprofessional. I would recommend other Dominican restaurants in the area that would care more about how they treat their customers and if your planning on going on a dinner date I recommend sleeping this place.

I've had worse, but do agree that it was pretty bad.I ordered the Eggs Benedict with lox, whereas some dishes my family ordered included seafood marinara, tuna melt, pastrami, macaroni and cheese, etc. My Eggs Benedict came with really salty lox on top of a burnt English muffin, topped off with weird looking sauce that didn't resemble Hollandaise. The seafood marinara had decent shrimp, but the scallop was rubbery and tasted frozen. My other half's pastrami was dry like cardboard. Worst of all, my niece's tuna melt was BURNT and STUCK ON HER PLATE, and the cheese was NOT MELTED. Yes, it was a \"tuna unmelt\" vs a tuna melt. I do want to commend the staff for providing friendly service. The gentleman who assisted us took the tuna melt off our tab and gave us all complementary ice cream (topped with whipped cream for some reason).

I however change it up from a triple decker turkey club to the Grecian Platter which is $17 and it has stuffed dolmades (grape leaves), chicken kebobs, fried calamari, greek salad, and feta and spinach pie.

The place actually had a decent amount of people when we arrived around 9:30pm and we were able to be seated at a table.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the hummus to start and the dorado for my main course.The hummus was decent, though I thought having super wet vegetables in the hummus when it arrived was a little odd and made it more watery than I would have liked.The dorado started off pretty tasty, but I encountered several bones--which is a big no-no for me. The fish was flaky and tender, but the many bones that I found really were off-putting.I also had the opportunity to try my friend's scallops and they were cooked pretty well.Overall, this is a cute little spot that seems to be a local hang out.

There couldn't have been a better place to fall in love all over again! The minute we entered the restaurant we were treated like we were the only ones that existed although it was packed. And that person who greeted us was Lucas. We ate at the bar, our favorite spot. We were not packed in like sardines. We were given plenty of space. Excellent cocktails to begin with. Ask for Alex or Francisco to make your drink and you will never go wrong. A special menu was created and executed by Executive Chef Edi Seitllari. Phenomenal is an understatement! A well prepared thought out menu that they quoted as a five course prix fix although it seemed to be never ending! We both started out with the Glazed Oyster Rockefeller. Then I had the Shrimp Mac & Cheese while John had the Prawn Tempura with Sweet Chile Sauce. Our third course we both had the New Aged Caesar Salad In Puff Pastry. The fourth course we both had the 8oz Filet Mignon with a coconut cake, in a Burgundy Mushroom Wine Sauce. The fifth course John had the Chocolate Lava Cake and I had the Chocolate Dipped Strawberries. Nothing was wrong with this entire meal! In fact, we'll take it a step further. If we knew we were going to have one more meal before we die we would request that Chef Edi prepare it! Lucas made the entire place romantic with the candles and all of the red heart shaped balloons floating through the restaurant. We were made to feel so welcome and once you wrap yourself in this dining experience it's simply hard to leave. But once we did leave and walked out the door we knew the fantasy had disappeared and we were back in the real world. We will be back many times and we consider this one of our all time favorite restaurants. Anyone who visits this restaurant will not regret Lucas serving up his hospitality and Chef Edi's menu and all the staff for making our Valentine's Day and \"Affair to Remember!\" Best wishes from Allan France & John Valentino"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "review": "Just a baby, being open less than a year now I can already see The Shadmoor becoming a neighborhood staple.

We had hightailed it to move in, didn't stop moving in for 5 hours, and realized we needed to eat. We didn't know what we wanted, and just wandered around our new neighborhood. We were able to walk at 8pm and sit at the bar without a problem. The atmosphere is awesome. It's nautical city chic, authentic but also interesting. It has the most amazing art pieces, really cool rope/lighting features, and a beautiful wooden bar. It its small, narrow, but doesn't feel it. It has a speakeasy bathroom door, that looks like a line of book shelves. They really paid significant attention to detail in the decorations and atmosphere, and it was a great touch. I also loved the music.. every song had me saying \"this is my favorite song\". The menu is unique, with many seafood dishes (they are known for their octopus dish), but also appealing options if you don't like seafood. We split the calamari appetizer, which was the 2nd best calamari I have ever had. So fresh, crisp, and so much flavor. It was insane. The swordfish was seasoned and cooked perfect... it was good, with no problems, but wasn't anything special. Greg's chicken was the same- flavorful and delicious, but nothing special. \u00a0Our experience here was memorable and a great way to start our life in NYC.

However, I do feel the portions could be larger if the establishment wanted to make them larger, given the price points. Affordable yes, but keeps me full? Quite frankly, no. I do find myself a bit hungry within three hours. But this could also be as a result of not having yet fully accommodated to the vegan diet. Who knows? Maybe in a couple months I'll be fully trained, or a vegan veteran to be able to tackle a sandwich from here once more and not be hungry within five hours of consumption. I also do think that, as a vegan, it is something to be mindful of and to be attentive to these changing patterns + frequencies in cravings.. Especially when your body feels hungry.

The only reason I would give this 4.5 stars is because I asked to add tofu to my sandwich and they said that option was not available.

I wouldn't normally think \"God, I have to have me some vegan and vegetarian sammies\". . . . but God, I haven't lived, I needed some of those sammies. A trio of us came in this weekend and I tried both a grilled cheese with kale and pesto and their traditional Chana Masala sandwiches. The grilled cheese is used with mozzarella and is oozing and decadent. (Okay, not everything here is vegan, but most of everything is at least vegetarian from what I can tell). Their sell out sandwich the Chana Masala was unique but I enjoyed it. The main base is of chickpeas smashed up with a homemade date chutney sauce, mixed greens, and pickled onions, and comes with a side of insanely legit spicy masala sauce. I love spice so this was a wham of intense flavors. Even walking in to this little shop all you smell is fragrant and amazing Indian spices marinating in the air. They also sell wraps, salads, and gluten-free bowls and platters with stuff like lentils and quinoa and tofu and veggie mashes. Like all healthy stuff with really cool spices integrated into their food products. Also smoothies and coffees which they use with from what I can tell almond milk and other natural products. Everything is also reasonably priced and nothing costs much more than $10 or less.

You claimed to be the OWNER! So you're LYING!! 2. I DID NOT BUY $70 worth of drinks! So YES! That's another mistake your bartender made. I bought hookah from the hookah guy. (separate from the bartender and I ordered two drinks) 3. I did NOT leave a $3 tip. My other friend might of left that. I left $6. Either way we ALL TIPPED for our drink! You guys are VERY SNEAKY! And it should be at the customer discretion of much needs to be Tipped!!! EVERY employee DOES NOT DESERVE 18% tip! You guys just TRY to RIP people off from a small establishment! AND No i DID Look at my receipt, and I stated that. What I said was that NOT EVERYONE LOOKS At every single word on a receipt. So I didn't see in such a dark establishment where it said \"18% Gratuity included\" THE proper thing to do is let a customer know thatGratuity would be added! Never heard of such thing as a bar adding Gratuity to a party of two.. not including a friend We met there that had her separate card. So PLEASE Get ur facts straight before you come on here thinking you're actually saying something to FOOL people into coming to ur establishment! I HOPE EVERYONE READS this and become cautious at how sneaky this hookah bar is! And I DECLINED your round of Shots because I was already upset that you guys were sneaky about things. And I never said a partial refund I said I wanted a refund of my Gratuity! And that is possible to do. It's called crediting a card back! And if you guys was to have charged me on accident then you guys would have refunded me with no issues! So save the BS for an uneducated individual! Like I said I WILL NEVER RETURN AND I HOPE EVERYONE TAKES EXTRA PRECAUTIONS BEFORE ENTERING YOUR ESTABLISHMENT! THIEVES!!!!!! I'm also glad to know I wasn't the only guest that entered your establishment feeling ROBBED! I read all of the reviews! Wish I read them prior to going there.. SMDHYou need to learn proper customer etiquette. Customer is ALWAYS RIGHT! Bribing me of free shots does not Impress me. In fact it's unprofessional.. what ?? you're going to offer free shots just to charge us another $15 in Gratuity?? NO THANK YOU! NEVER AGAIN!!! WARNING \u203c\u203c DO NOT COME HERE BECAUSE THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF AND TELL YOU BY LAW THAT THEY CAN DO THAT TO YOU! I went there on Saturday 11/19 with my sister and girlfriend. I ordered a few drinks and made sure to tip my bartender. I signed my receipt and when I got home I realized I was charged more than expected. They charged me $15 in Gratuity! So I called asking to speak to the owner and she stated \u00a0that she was the owner & that her name was V. I explained my situation to her and she asked me if I was verbally told that I was going to be charged Gratuity. I told her Absolutely Not because had I known that I would of never tipped my bartender extra and I would have paid in cash. She said that she would look into it and call me back. I then received a phone call from a different person. So now a man is now claiming to be the owner and he asked me if I was verbally told and I stated again No. he then proceeded to tell me that by law as long as it's written on the receipt that Gratuity was added that the bartender does not have to tell me. He was very unprofessional and rude. Did nothing to refund me my money. I will NEVER step foot into that bar again! I've NEVER heard of going to a bar and being charged Gratuity. UNLESS you are buying bottles or It's a party of 5 or more. I wouldn't care so much had the bartender informed me that and I wasn't tipping on top of that.. but Lesson LEARNED & NEVER AGAIN! I feel CHEATED & disrespected! NotOnly was I cheated but lied to when I first called asking to speak to the \"Owner\". NEVER AGAIN! Also, the bar is very small and you feel like you are on top of one another!

My co-worker and I got there about 45 minutes before our reservation after work on Tuesday evening. \u00a0They seated us right away and had no issue with us arriving before schedule.The prefixe menu was slightly different from the regular menu, \u00a0but that's to be expected. I had read previous reviews and some said the place was great while others said the place was horrible. I read that someone else had gotten the prefixe and ordered the steak so I was really looking forward to a steak. However, that was not a choice on the menu. \u00a0So I settled for the one of the other two beef choices which was short ribs. I also ordered the seafood chowder. My friend ordered chicken milanese and her soup choice was a garden vegetable soup. For dessert she chose the 7 layer blackout and I chose the ice cream trio. We were offered the choice of still,sparkling or tap water. We chose still.Food- Short ribs- although boneless & tender, very small, \u00a0one piece with a lot of fat served over a small portion of mashed potato, two carrots and chipolini onions that were undercooked. The whole dish was very bland and lacked salt. Did the chef forget that salt brings out the flavor of dishes? Seafood chowder- it had pieces of salmon, \u00a0cubed potaoes, pieces of shrimp and bacon in a creamy broth. Do they call that seafood? And who puts salmon in soup? I guess since two of their dishes on the menu are salmon they use it more ways. \u00a0The shrimp were a tad under for my taste.Chicken milanese- Although it was a huge portion it had no flavor at all. Again lacking salt and this type of dish if there was salt available on the table wouldn't do it any justice after being fried. Salad was nice. \u00a0But to me not a complete meal.Bread- no bread basket placed on table. \u00a0Instead they come around and offer you one piece from a choice of salted baguette, cranberry roll, or sourdough. All of which are hard slightly warmed and hard to cut into. Seven layer cake- just ok nothing spectacular same goes for the ice cream. The three flavors were chocolate, vanilla and malted. I didn't care for the malted.With this meal you had a choice of coffee, tea or soda. Since we chose water my friend had coffee we weren't expecting a check for the water. \u00a0I've never been charged for still water. It was $6.53 Service was ok, the server did come check on us once. I did notice he was a bit more friendlier to a group who was ordering from the regular menu. We looked at the regular menu and noticed there were a few things on there that seemed good. \u00a0I wouldn't go back. \u00a0Their food is bland and there are many other places to eat in the city.I won't tell the person who gifted me the tickets. \u00a0He paid $55 per person and I kind of feel bad that it wasn't worth it"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2016", "review": "Amazing!

The four us sampled a little of each others plates and here's what was in the mix among everyone: the State Beef Burger (with the house fries), the tater tots, the crab cake, and the mixed greens salad. The burger was amazing. If I ever returned, I would definitely order that. I've had better crab cakes and salads. However the tater tots were to die for. They're infused with jalapenos, cheese, and bacon, and they came with Russian sauce.

(Excellent move!)-We made a list of what we wanted to order from an online menu, which, Preet (the gentleman who took our order on the phone) said he can help us out with. They are still in transition, so their online menu is not ready yet, but Preet was very kind, helpful and courteous with our choices.-Our order was: Lamb Do Pyaza \u00a0(Lamb with two onions) $12.99, Mughal Darbar Special Mixed Grill ($17.95) and (2) Tandoori Naan ($4.00). It was a 30 minute wait to pick up; Our gracious Mom did the honors, lol :-) The total came out to be: $38.04. We paid by cash but they do accept CC. The food was hot and smelled absolutely curry-licious! LoL we couldn't wait to dive in!-As we took out each piping hot dish: I noticed they gave 4 different chutneys for the Mixed grill dish, two boxes of Basmati Rice in two pint containers, the Lamb Do Pyaza, and a small container of Suji Halwa. (Suji Halwa is an Indian dessert made out of Semolina, sugar, cardamom, raisins and ghee (clarified butter), the Tandoori Naan (cut in half) and there was a small paper bag that had papadam inside! What a yummy surprise! Papadam is a thin, crispy and crunchy food that you crush and sprinkle over your rice!-The first thing we attacked was the Mughal Darbar Special Mixed Grill filled with juicy, flavorful, spicy, finger licking meat and shrimp. It included tandoori chicken, shrimp, kebab, fish, and lamb pieces with a side salad and lemons, garnished with red onions. The Kebab pieces were \u00a0to die for! It was cooked to *PERFECTION* the masala spices blended so well and I wish we had a plate full of Chef Shariff's delicious kebabs only! The green chutney that came with it was a great complement to the kebab. I can still taste the juicy kebab flavors in my mouth!-The Lamb Do Pyaza was good too. The curry paste was really a delight for my tastebuds. It wasn't spicy at all (Good for my brother! haha), some pieces of the lamb were soft and semi-soft, but it was a delicious curry to go with the Basmati Rice and with the Tandoori Naan.-The Naan was really good, soft, not doughy at all, not hard, just baked to the right temperature and easy to break apart with your fingers and dip in the lamb dish!-The Suji Halwa was ok. It wasn't overly sweet, there were no cashews or raisins (winner!) lol It was a nice touch to the overall lunch we truly enjoyed.-Good to see a brand new restaurant with a new touch of Indian cuisine to the neighborhood. -**Special Shout out** to Chef Shariff and to Preet! The food is amazing! Had authentic mughal flavors added to each dish and we cannot wait to try out the Chicken Biryani and other Vegetarian dishes! :o)"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2017", "review": "Amazing authentic Indian food and friendly staff !!!Delivery always quick and correct."}, {"star": 1.0, "date": "4/2/2017", "review": "2 hours still waiting for delivery.

The dish was framed as a piece of art, served on a shiny rectangle of porcelain, sauce decadently underpinning the modest spread of noodles, the top verdant with rolls of scallion. But these impostors existed in a realm of boring balance, having not travelled through any territory of nutty, savory, or sweet. They were shared, consumed, and, without the impinging effect of hype gone sour, I'd say they were ok.Table morale was lifted when a plate of Dry Saut\u00e9ed Tangy Crispy Beef slid on to the cloth. Slivers of saut\u00e9ed garlic and Szechuan pepper accompanied thick threads of tender beef encased in sweetened, crunchy shells. When my hand began its descent towards the last piece of this crowd pleaser, a pair of dexterously operated chop sticks swooped in from across the table and snatched up the sole survivor.Tang's Amazing Spicy Wine Chicken should be simply abbreviated to Tang's Chicken as I could not detect any of its favorable or descriptive adjectives. Hot Tang Tang Noodles came in a bath of chili broth that was too thin to imbue flavor on its dish mate.

It's less clear who played the pioneering role in bringing this spicy cuisine to the Big Apple, but a chef who goes by Shorty Tang comes close to that designation, with the legendary sesame noodles whose imitations are now almost everywhere in Chinese restaurants in the city, if not the country. When I heard chef Shorty's daughter re-opened the original Hwa Yuan restaurant that her father had opened in 1968 before closing in the 1980s, I was very eager to check it out. While Hwa Yuan had some delicious dishes, Jun and I were expecting a bit more authentic (and spicy) side of the Sichuan tradition.The massive menu at Hwa Yuan may initially make you feel lost. Fortunately, Jun and I visited the restaurant with another couple, so we had a room for ordering as many dishes as we liked. One dish for the sake of history lesson that you try to begin your meal is the iconic cold noodles with sesame sauce. It was a delicious start to our dinner with the sweet sesame sauce that would help get your palate going. On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend ordering any dumplings, at least not the horrific pork soup dumplings (Jun said of all the Chinese restaurants she had visited in America, this was the worst xiao long bao). In looking at the menu, Jun and I spotted a note that we can control how spicy we would like the food that we order to be. We should've heeded that note and asked for an authentic spicy level for all of our other dishes because while none of them were bad, no single dish displayed the kind of spicy kick to your palate that makes the Sichuan cuisine so addictive in the first place. Kung po baby mix potatoes was one of the favorites from the group, and I thought the Tang's Amazing Tofu was also pretty decent. The group had some mixed reactions to the Tang's Amazing Spicy Wine chicken (it's often hard to find a dish with an \"amazing\" adjective that lives up to its name) as well as the whole fish with hot bean sauce. The flavor for these dishes was all on the sweeter side, perhaps to accommodate non-Asian diners who can't handle spice as well as their Asian counterparts do. I get the restaurant's target audience, but when I think of all the amazing Sichuan restaurants in the city that never shy away from making the diners feel their tongues burn, Hwa Yuan felt like a safe play than an adventure to the land of Sichuan. Getting a reservation wasn't too difficult online and the dining space is on three separate floors so you won't have a lot of trouble getting seated on short notice. Order a bottle of Tsingtao to complement your meal (in my experience, wine can have mixed effects when you try Sichuan food). While I don't know what the original Hwa Yuan looked like, the overall vibe of the remodeled one seems a little bit more shiny and touristy than other more modest establishments in the Chinatown. I don't know if Jun and I will go back anytime soon to Hwa Yuan; when we do, we will certainly tell the server we can hold any level of spiciness and dare the kitchen to try its best in making us sweat and cry from their food."}, {"star": 2.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "review": "Food was generally tasty.

Whole fish - very good. Eggplant - we'll never know. I will say that after speaking with the Hostess she did make a generous concession to us, but we weren't there for a free meal.

The menu was super basic and straightforward - they didn't have anything unique to set them apart. On top of a basic menu, they also had ridiculously high prices for a Chinatown restaurant.We started with the Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce which was actually very decent and wolfed it down. The Sauce was a little on the heavy side but nothing to really complain about. Second, we tried the Dry Sauteed Tangy Crispy Beef, which was way too sweet and felt like I was almost eating candy based on how sweet it was. On the plus side, it was not chewy nor were there any poor slices of meat (they were all very quality cut pieces of beef). Third course, we ordered the homemade mushroom soup, which was decent but did not blow me away based on the price. For our main course, we split the classic kung pao chicken and Chinese eggplant. The kung pao chicken actually tasted a little fishy which was very strange, almost as if they had lathered fish sauce on the chicken. The peanuts also were simply sprinkled on top - they should be mixed into the dish with the sauce/seasoning and not simply added on top. Eggplant was excellent but then again it's hard to mess-up that classic Chinese dish.

I figured I'd try to avoid a long wait on line during the lunch rush, so I placed an order to be ready for pick up at 12:45. When I got there, there was a long line of people waiting for pick up (separate from the regular line), but there wasn't much order to it. The employee at the door first said to wait on this line for pick up. About 15 minutes later she said that it wasn't actually a line and to just push your way to the cashier....this didn't make much sense. Long story short, 30 minutes later I am still waiting and so is everyone else waiting for pick up. They said they only had one person doing the pick up orders....but they didn't seem to have anyone's names or orders anywhere to be found. Almost 40 minutes later the exasperated cashier (who I feel sorry for having to deal with all the chaos of unfilled pick up orders, that was in no way her fault) finally gave up and asked everyone waiting for pick up to just fill out an order form that they would then fast track over to the people assembling the bowls. I marked down my order on the sheet and a little while later I had my bowl ready to go. So my pick up order took over half an hour of waiting for once I got there (an hour after I initially ordered). I got off easy though because when I left there was still a long line of people out the door just waiting for their nonexistent pick up orders. I figured maybe this was a one time issue or to just never order ahead again and just wait on the line (people that got on the line after people showed up for pick up orders made it through with their meals much quicker than the pick ups). However, once I finally made it back to the office with my food (by the time my lunch hour was over), I realized they forgot a bunch of items in my order.

I also asked about a promo about a free miso soup I had scrolled past on social media the other day (but couldn't remember where), to which they coolly responded that the promo had ended.

I'd been hearing so much about this place, I had to get over there and try as much as possible in one sitting, which ended up being five slices: a margherita, pepperoni, spicy salami, burrata, and l'industrie.The basics here are fantastic, particularly the crust, which is super sturdy but airier than you'd get at some of the other great crust spots in the city, such as Di Fara's or Scarr's. The tomato sauce is on the sweeter side, which is how I prefer it. And it's less greasy/oily than many of the other comparable places, which you could make good arguments either for or against.All the toppings were pretty fresh and the slices were all great, but I have to say, the l'industrie is one of the best slices I've had in the city.

E facile---L-I-N-D-U-S-T-R-I-E.Now for English translation. How do you spell beyond good or superb? It's easy, find & hop on the G train, get off at Metropolitan station and head on over to L'industrie pizza (S2 Street).I had a fantastic experience at this adorable, quaint pizzeria.From the outside, you might think you are stepping into one of the many standard pizza parlors--but looks are deceiving--and so untrue with this establishment. Once inside, the magic takes place. Always on a never ending quest to savor good pizza, I found L'Industrie on--where else?---Yelp. It was given stellar reviews.Since I trust my fellow Yelpers, I knew I had to try it for myself.What I really appreciated about this establishment is that you're able to order pizza by the slice. This is particularly helpful for a lunch meal.Keep in mind (and look at my pictures outlining the menu containing delicious creations), this is no ordinary pizza. L'Industrie opened about a year ago or so & I was very pleased to meet the owner, Massimo. He actually makes the pizza!! As I mentioned in another review, we have lost many Italians in the pizza making business. On this given day, Massimo was hospitable and answered any questions I had (and I always have them). I was so torn looking at the menu and trying to decide. To the left of the counter, the chalkboard menu contained pizza styles in \"rosse\" meaning with red sauce. And to the right, there were those in \"bianche\" without sauce. My head was spinning.I \u00a0immediately observed that all these creations must be made with pride and love. This passion results in the quality of the finished product.What's also cool is that you may order a 14\" , 18\" pie or by the slice (and yes, any creation/style can be applied to the slice which is rare).Massimo recommended the Burrata slice which contained the following: sauce, EVOO, parmigiana cheese, mozzarella, burrata and basil.However, I planted my eyes on the Tartufo and settled for that. This style contained the following toppings: mozzarella, ricotta, Portobello mushrooms and truffle sauce.Guess what? Massimo was so kind that I was presented with both slices (one slice was on the house from him---the Burrata--only substituted with truffle oil since I mentioned I really like it). I thought it was such a nice gesture. The moment of truth was when I took a bite of the pizza which looked too good to sink my teeth into. Verdict? It was beyond delicious. The crust was light, crispy and airy. The toppings were amazing. All the flavors combined very well. I honestly can't choose a favorite between the two slices I devoured. I really loved the meatiness of the mushrooms in the Tartufo slice but I was wowed by the burrata from the Burrata slice.This pizza parlor is teeny but the atmosphere is endearing and decorated with love (as is the pizza--cooked the same way). There are about 3 tables and some counter seating near the window.I am eager to return and try the fig and goat cheese creation and/or the caramelized onion and Brie. But if you want to keep things simple--there's always good old Margherita. Plenty of options to keep both vegetarians and carnivores satisfied.L'Industrie exceeded my expectations and is included in my top 10 pizza favorites (which in my opinion, Brooklyn reigns supreme).Grazie mille, Massimo!FYI, cash only."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "review": "Very good pizza and excellent service One of the top of pizza in Williamsburg very delicious everything"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "review": "Wow, tiny unassuming place with truly outstanding pizza.

Just as I was finishing, the cook, waiter, chef, boss came over to me and said,\"try this\". My square. OMG. He made me a Sicilian pizza. I shoved that square down so fast.

I suppose most people find more cheese to always be a good thing, and it does add a different texture element.The workers are nice and super prompt here.

At first, I thought there was too much seasoning and it was quite salty, but, in retrospect, the juiciness of the chicken definitely outweighs that. Seriously, come get this chicken--it's so good. The side of Old Bay fries only boosted the meal. I already love thin, crunchy fries, but then they go ahead and add one of the best seasonings, Old Bay, on top. I went to favorite fried chicken place a few days after my visit here, and it just wasn't the same because I had Belle's Hot Chicken on my mind.

The food took a while to come despite that it wasn't busy but the wait was worth it.Fish salad was delish. It was grilled, simply seasoned and the greens consisted of some arugula, Romaine lettuce and spinach (from my memory). The Banjan was a nice addition to my meal. It wasn't that spicy or salty.

I hate the lamb gyro and fries and it was the best I've had in NYC, maybe best ever. Chef Zack is the man!I stopped by on a cold, slow Sunday night with my buddy who had been here before. He set my expectations at a 5 (out of 10), but my first bite was amazing (totally undersold this place). The fries and kicker sauce are packed with flavor. Some other reviewers were commenting that the fries were salty (bunch of cry babies who should eat a salad!), but I didn't think it was at all, then again I like my food to have flavor. The lamb gyro is also layered with flavors, definitely well seasoned. I loved the slightly sour and mellow flavor of the cucumber/white sauce that went along with the meat. The salty and sour went so well together. As background, I grew up in Detroit which has the largest Arab American population in the US, so I grew up eating this stuff at restaurants and family and friend's homes and have had a good experience eating middle eastern/Mediterranean food. I don't trust most people's tastes, especially in NY, when it comes to kebabs, shawarmas and gyros, so some of the mediocre reviews for this place don't hold much merit to me. Here's the most important thing: the food is prepared with TLC. I had the privilege of speaking with Zack, the guy who cooked all our food, and found out he was from Afghanistan. That gave me so much more faith in this place and totally made sense why the food tasted so good. He told us that he tries to prepare as many foods fresh as possible, even though it takes a little more time to get food to hungry customers. You can tell he has a real passion for his work and tries to make sure people enjoy the food. For a small place that charges a very low (for NY standards) price, it's incredible to see someone give a crap about the food you put in your mouth. Anyway, give this place a try. You won't be disappointed. This place is incredible. To all those haters: please stop complaining about salty food and stop coming here if you don't like food that actually tastes good.

While planning a recent Queens food crawl, I was determined to include a stop for Momos. \u00a0No, not Mofos. \u00a0I said, Momos. \u00a0As in delicious, juicy Himalayan Dumplings. Thing is, though, Queens offers a wealth of options. \u00a0And I was feeling overwhelmed.Enter brand new Yelp peep, Scott T. \u00a0And not a moment (or should I say, momo?) too soon. Massive thanks to you for recommending this place! \u00a0It was the runaway highlight of a long day, that trust me, included some tasty eats:Anyway, like virtually everyone else, I ordered the Momo Soup, aka Jhol Momo. \u00a0Sharing with hubby, from our first bite of slippery, flavor-packed dumplings, bathed in an ultra thick, rich, spicy broth, we were utterly smitten! After reading up a bit on this popular Nepalese street food, it seems the broth gets its richness from sesame paste and is traditionally served cold(?). \u00a0Ours was lukewarm, like it had some sort of identity crisis and didn't know what temperature it wanted to be, but it didn't matter. \u00a0And though I was afraid the chicken filling we went with would be disappointing v. the beef option, it was anything but. \u00a0While we were savoring every last bit of this truly transcendent dish, hubby noticed a large, thin Doughnut of sorts on another table. \u00a0It looked almost like an imperfectly round hula hoop designed for an American Girl Doll. But anyway, hubby decided to order one, and also requested some hot sauce. \u00a0This Doughnut, which I later found out is called Sel Roti, was also utterly delicious! \u00a0It had a fun, sort of squidgy texture that could probably be attributed to rice flour, and was faintly sweet. \u00a0It had been made fresh, so it was served warm.The hot sauce my chilehead hubby requested deserves a paragraph all its own. \u00a0It was a combination of grated tomato and some sort of chile paste. \u00a0And you see, growing up in Israel, hubby was raised on weekend breakfasts, featuring a flaky flatbread called Melawach, served with grated tomato and Zhoug, a chile, parsley, cilantro, and garlic paste that must be having a moment since you can now find it at Trader Joe's. \u00a0But I digress... \u00a0Let's just say, our minds were blown by the flavor similarities. \u00a0This small storefront, with its smattering of tables and some counter space for dining, ain't fancy, nor did I expect it to be. \u00a0There is a restroom, but I avoided using it, lest it shatter my illusion that at least the kitchen was clean. \u00a0Ish.For under $10, I enjoyed a delicious meal that both surprised and transported me. \u00a0In very good ways.

Heavenly multigrain bread, thick layer of avo, great poached egg and a few pomegranate seeds on the side. Catch isn't portion shy and that's one of the most attractive characteristics of a restaurant: being capable of measuring the exact amount you are supposed to offer to your customers and avoiding excess, which is ultimately a waste. Asked for smoked salmon on the side and I got half a fish, speechless (again, I love you Catch). Besides my food rave, the place is airy and the atmosphere pleasant, nice summer/spring/good mood colors and easy access to a nice rooftop as well.

This place definitely has some amazing cocktails, they really know how to mix their drinks and have some great tasting creations. My favorite cocktail has to be the Kali, this is a jalape\u00f1o infused type of drink with tequila so if you're a fan of a spicy drink this is a must place to go and get some! However, these delicious drinks do come with a bit of a hefty price tag but they are worth it as you always have to appreciate a well put together drink. As far as the food - we had the chicken buns and the chicken lettuce wraps for our appetizers. For our main courses we got the Porterhouse steak (their special), the tomahawk steak (side of lobster Mac and cheese) as well as their scallops. Let's put it this way, no one was disappointed. They do not have a steak sauce but the waitress brought out some delicious sauce which complimented each steak. For dessert we had the cinnamon doughnut with ice cream as well as their blueberry pie (fancy and delicious pop tart)!

This place is HORRIBLE. We arrived on time for our reservation at 10pm and were told to wait at the bar until our pager buzzed. My friend and I ordered 2 vodka soda's at the bar which I paid for at a very cheap price of 40$ total (hah) (18$ per drink). A half hour later it buzzed for us to get our table (which was sooo refreshing considering we waited almost 3 hours for a table WITH A RESERVATION at Lavo the previous night). We were seated between two couples at a 2 top table in the corner because they reserve the 3, 4 and 5 person tables for people of that size party. Considering we were at Dos Caminos Midtown earlier that day and had a booth which could seat 5 people speaks to the kind of hospitality at Catch, but I understand they're busy every night of the week and can't accommodate requests like that. Unless you are spending 500-600$ on food/drinks they do not care about your experience. Food is over priced and the dishes are super super (super) small. Our waiter was nice enough but seemed disappointed that we weren't spending an exorbitant amount on dinner. My friend ordered the scallop gnocchi for 30$ and it was the size of an appetizer. I understand scallops are expensive as well as truffles but there were no visible shaved truffles on the dish and it clearly got its \"truffle\" flavor from truffle oil. When you go to a place where a pasta dish costs 30$ I would expect the truffle flavor to come from fresh, shaved truffles instead of some kind of indistinguishable truffle flavored oil (just saying). I ended up not being very hungry and ordered 4 pieces of the crunchy rice tuna. I left 2 of my 4 crunchy rice rolls on the plate and the bus boy frowned when I told him I didn't need a to-go box. They were fine but nothing like the original crispy rice appetizer at Nobu down the street. Complete knock off and not really worth the 25$ price tag. Rice was impossible to cut because it was so hard and tasted like it was straight out of the fryer. On our way out we were accosted by several drunk, belligerent middle aged men in the elevator who pushed past us and stumbled into a cab.

They also list what is gluten-free, making this an awesome place for people with dietary restrictions to eat with a group of people. MUST TRY: crispy cauliflower. It looked like fried shrimp, but instead it was delicious crispy little bites of fried cauliflower coated in a flavorful and slightly spicy sauce (tasted like sweet and sour almost). I also really loved the hearts of palm vegan \"crab cake\". Such an interesting texture that mimics flaky crab. The sweet potato gnocchi was delicious and is more filling that the other two vegan dishes. The dishes was $20-$22 each so it is on the pricey side.

Clarissa recommended it and said it was amazing and guess what? IT WAS AMAZING!!! Enjoyed every moment of it. The lobster Mac n cheese was very good also and filling. My girlfriend had the grilled octopus which I also had a taste of and it was tasty. A couple of friends had the lobster roll which was also mouth watering. Everything we had was very delicious.

The place is always packed, so make those reservations!The ambiance is trendy. Definitely a hot, hip place right now. Dim lighting, tons of tables tightly squished together to fit the overflowing crowds. Loud noise levels. You have to talk really, really loud to hear what the people sitting across from you are saying. The music on the background was surprisingly great: modern hits mixed with some timeless classics that make you hum happily as you're enjoying your delicious meal.The service is swift, courteous and friendly. Not too overbearing. Our waiter checked in on us, but understood when to leave us alone. Helped with menu recommendations.All the cocktails we ordered were not too strong, but tasty and worth a try nonetheless. The standouts were 'one too many' and 'the pineapple trainwreck'. Fruity, light, and flavorful. Went down with the food really well.Ordered a ton of incredible food. The flavors were seriously fantastic and refreshing. Recommend all of the below. Lobster Mac and cheese--very creamy but wish there were more lobster chunks in there.Chicken meatball as well as fillet skewers were incredibly delicious. Very tender. Perfectly seasoned. Flavorful, tangy sauces complemented and brought out the sweetness and savory-ness of the meats.Tuna tartare crunchy rice cakes--amazing tuna, fresh and full of flavor, resting on crispy blocks of rice.Chicken lettuce cups--a surprising gem that we ordered a second helping of. Fresh, tender iceberg lettuce leaf filled with juicy chicken and teriyaki sauce. Perfectly seasoned, delicate, and crunchy. Damn, it was good!Crispy chicken bao buns--similar to chicken lettuce cups, but delicious in their own, unique way. Tender chicken bursting with flavor on fresh, warm, pillowy bao buns.Mushroom spaghetti--creamy white sauce spaghetti with wild mushrooms. Sooo falvorful. Definitely an unexpected highlight that everyone at our table appreciated.Side of parmesan truffle fries--crunchy and crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside. Perfectly seasoned.Crispy shrimp--the shell was crispy and sweet, paired well with spicy mayo. Delicious, but out of all the dishes we tasted, this was the simplest and one that you can pass in favor of all the other delicacies. Scallops were to die for. Just perfectly tender and flavorful. The sear, the seasoning--it's like you die and go to heaven.Lamb chops [sadly only two chops per portion] with kale pesto were out of this world! The meat melted in my mouth--barely any chewing to be done. The most tender, juicy, and well-seasoned chops I've ever had, and I've tasted my fair share. Definitely a must to indulge.

Delicious.Food: For appetizers, we could not decide! All menu options looked so tempting. After much deliberation, we decided to get the steamed mussels. So. Good. \u00a0We were so close in ordering another one because it was that good. For entrees, I got the snapper and my boyfriend got the filet mignon. Out of both entrees, the filet mignon was better hands down. However, since I am not much of a red meat eater, I wouldn't get it for myself and was fully satisfied with my dish. Snapper was fresh and delicious. But, if you're a meat lover, don't pass up the filet mignon, you'll thank me later.

Not too much breading on the shrimp and the sauce was a perfect sweet tang. Salmon Carpaccio - Salmon was fresh but the Yuzu was overpowering and extremely salty Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes - These were delicious! Fluffy and not dry at all. The carameled pecans and the frosting were the perfect compliment and we didn't even need to use the syrup. Grilled Mahi Mahi - This was the best main dish that we had. The glaze on the side had a truffle taste to it which was a perfect match.Grilled Swordfish - This dish was slightly dry. I would recommend the Mahi Mahi over the swordfish if you are going with a fish dish.My friend ordered a coffee at the beginning of the meal and didn't get it until we were almost done with the meal. And instead they brought an iced tea first. It can get extremely hectic during brunch hours so be patient with the waiters. Overall, we had an okay experience. Dishes are hit or miss.

First of all, we were the only people there, and while there were 4 employees on the floor, it was unclear where we should order BECAUSE no one acknowledged us. When we finally did order, it took wayyyyy too long. Their reason? I-CE NY had run out of whipped cream. Which, had there been whipped cream freshly made on top of our ice cream, that would have made it acceptable. On top of that, I've never been to a rolled ice cream place that made such tiny rolls. I guess they fill their sundaes with whipped cream because without it, my partner's cup was less than half full.

I got the cookie spree expecting it to be similar to ten below's Oreo ice cream. While the ice cream itself was creamy, I didn't like the flavor of the combo itself. The chocolate sauce tasted weird and wasn't a good drizzle for the ice cream itself. I wish I tasted more of a cookies and cream base rather than a sweet cream base.

It's certainly not there to provide customers with a delicious and pleasant ice-cream-shop experience.The first thing you notice when you walk in is the constant clanging and banging... this is the result of the staff scraping and chopping ice cream mix as it freezes on an \"anti-griddle\"... a metallic, super-cold slab. The sound is like the \"Anvil Chorus\" from Verdi's \"Il Trovatore\", but without the rhythmic precision and vocal accompaniment. It's an assault on the eardrums. I'm sure it entertains the kiddies, but adults may want to bring earplugs.The next thing is the overly complex menu. You start with an ice cream flavor, then you have to add a mix-in from a long list, then two \"toppings\" from another long list. Then a sauce. Then you pay your SEVEN DOLLARS, and wait... and wait... and wait... while the anvil-slammers hammer out your \"treat\".But it's not a treat. That's the real problem here. That long wait was not rewarded with a delicious bowl of chocolate ice cream... it was punished with a rock-hard bowl of brown, nearly flavorless ice-cream-crystals, flattened and then rolled into little cigar shapes that are almost impossible to eat neatly with a plastic spoon. I CE NY is very stingy with toppings and sauce, too... my KitKat topping consisted of three little bits of chocolate bar... they might have amounted to about 1/8 of a KitKat bar. The caramel sauce was close to MIA... I saw a drip here and there, but not enough to even register on the tongue. It was a sad day when Haagen-Dazs closed on Austin... that was REAL ice cream. The only thing real at I CE NY (even the name reeks of empty cleverness) was the smile on the pleasant young person who took my seven bucks."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "6/24/2017", "review": "Got the Thai Ice Tea & Strawberry Cheesecake.

But the cashier was very helpful on recommending the popular one which was the Thai Ice Tea base, lychee mix, lychee top, top cookie straw and sauce condensed milk. I switched the lychee top with Mochi, since I love mochi. The icecream was delicious! It was filled with flavor and not overwhelmingly sweet. I'm glad that I went with the mochi because it was definitely the perfect topping for the icecream. Everything was just right. I'm glad it wasn't just about the presentation as many of these new icecream places seem to be. They have a loyalty program card, buy 9 get 1 free and you can also get 20% off if you take a picture of your icecream and share it on your social media profile (fb, ig, yelp, etc).

After hearing about the location of this gathering, all i did was see what kind of restaurant it was, i did not read any reviews or even looked at the menu to discourage or encourage me from eating or ordering anything specific. Didn't want to come here with high or low expectations. They started us with a bunch of delicious appetizers. There were roasted asparagus, wild mushrooms, grilled breaded shrimp, fritto misto, carpaccio, \u00a0pork belly, arrancini and baby kale salad. The roasted asparagus was like any other asparagus, nothing special, the wild mushrooms were really tasty, it was on bed of cashew milk, so creamy like mashed potatoes. I think my fave was the fritto misto, very similar to fried tempura you get from a japanese restaurant. the batter was really light and airy but let me warn you though, they have different veggies that that of a japanese restaurant. i first took a bite of a lemon slice, and it was sour. It really was a punch in the face, while thinking it was a slice of zucchini. All the rest of the apps were good. As for the entree, i ordered the chicken under a brick. Not that i didn't want to order pasta, since it was an italian restaurant, i was there with a bunch of foodies and also my fianc\u00e9, so i know someone will order pasta. I wanted to order something different so others can try my dish. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the spaghetti, and oh boy, was the pasta al dente, it was cooked to perfection. Its as if we were eating a bowl or ramen and the ramen was the perfect texture, not too cooked or undercooked. It had such elasticity. They didn't drench the pasta with sauce, it was just enough. My chicken on the other hand was a tad dry, the flavor was there, but chicken was a dry. I also got to the try the wild branzino, it was good, light and tasty. That was actually my first choice but i went with chicken. No regrets though. The lasagna entree was big. if you were hungry, order that. i didn't get to try it but the person who ordered it said it was good and he ate the entire plate, so it must be good. And now for dessert. We got to try 4 different desserts, crostata, pannacotta, chocolate cake and bread pudding (although menu said tiramisu). They were all pretty tasty, but if i had to choose a fave, i would choose the chocolate cake, it was molten lava cake so it was warm and oozy with a scoop of ice cream. sounds pretty common of a dessert and its something you can get at many places, but i really enjoyed it here.

The service was great too. We loved the salmon tartare - it deserves 10 stars. The beef carpaccio was very tender and delicious.

I asked him a question regarding the menu and he got extremely aggressive about his dislike for avocado and started ranting about it-- so not what I was asking for, dude!! There was lots of rolling of eyes from his side whenever he \"waited on\" any of us.I will say that the location is great if you're hanging in Soho and looking to shop and wander all day, and the interior is very, very well designed.

Anyways, I tried the arancini, meatballs, and the brick chicken. Meatballs were a little dry, but the sauce was oily enough to sort of make up for it. The chicken was a little better, since it was mostly a dark meat cut, and the vegetables underneath were flavorful. The arancini, on the other hand, were pretty dry, and not tender enough. Oof. It really came down to the service, which was pretty spotty throughout the meal. We got our entrees at different points of the night, constantly had to ask for drink refills, and in the end, our waitress mixed up the check, and we had to run our credit cards twice. She also wasn't very apologetic about the whole ordeal, which I felt was not a good sign. Mistakes happen, but the attitude is really key.Food was decent, but not worth returning due to the service.

I felt so comfortable and airy having brunch at this restaurant. Service was great too. Not too overbearing but not too nonchalant either. My friend Gabby and I ordered 3 different dishes off the brunch menu, the Gravlax, the pancakes and the avocado toast. I enjoyed all three well although I did wish the avocado toast was toasted a biiiit more and for the pancakes to be a little smaller in size and more fluffier in texture, so if you're reading this, chefs of 'Bread'- definitely take these into consideration. The citrus and ricotta on top of the pancakes was such a different take on pancakes, rather than just slathering butter all over the pancakes and I enjoyed it a whole ton. The house cured salmon in the gravlax was a different texture than I usually have when ordering lox and bagels. It had a certain fattyness to it that I'm not use to and I'm not sure if I like it or feel indifferent to it.. The onions, capers and tomatoes were very fresh though (and omg the presentation of the dish was so nice). We also had potato hash as a side dish and oh wooow. Those little smashed potatoes were so delicious and wonderfully seasoned. I kinda enjoyed these potatoes the most.. and it's not just the carbs serenading my body, haha.I washed my brunch down with a cappuccino, which was amazing.Will I be back?

Most of the appetizer were finger food and they weren't being stingy at all. Plenty to go around and freshly made. The kumimoto oysters with pomegranate seed would have been even better if it was freshly shucked and still had the natural salt water in it. The mini riceball and pizza was very tasty.

But that was the old Bread, at 20 Spring Street, before the myriad of other cafe's and shops dared to venture below Prince Street.

But I'm in New York every couple months for work, and was excited to check out the new space. The best way to describe the new Bread is that it's an amplified version of the old one. Everything is a brighter, shiner version of its old self. The interior design mimics the old place, with the lots of clean white lines and bright pops of red, but it's a step up. And the tile is AMAZING - I saw it in some of the great little shops I saw in Italy this summer, and I fell in love with it!Similarly, the menu had many of my favorites from the old days - pressed Sicilian sardine sandwich, shrimp salad with avocado and tomato - but with some new things in rotation that were equally impressive: avocado toast with goat cheese and a new, extensive list of share plates and authentic pasta dishes. They were kind enough to make a half portion of pasta pomodoro for my son that made me wish I had the whole plate to finish! I went in the daytime, with my family in tow, but I'm looking forward to going back in the evening because the bar - open and airy -- looked at great as the cocktail list!

I'm talking about kimchi, pickled radish, anchovies, tofu, tomato salad, scallion salad, mac salad, steamed egg, I could go on. 2) Pineapple cubes and pumpkin slush at the end of your meal. Yes please! We arrived 45 minutes after they opened on a weekend and the restaurant was already packed with a wait. Fortunately, we didn't wait longer than 15 minutes for a table. The two of us decided to share the beef valentine combo (brisket, beef tongue, marinated short rib) which came with your choice of stew. We chose the kimchi stew. They grill the meats for you, which I appreciated, but I felt a little rushed to eat since once one meat was done grilling, they immediately put on the next round. The beef combo was great! I really enjoyed all the meats, especially the tongue. However, the star of the show was the kimchi stew. The broth was spicy and tangy with a slight tomato essence. I particularly loved the chunks of tender pork belly. Service was speedy and hospitable. They even helped portion out some of our dishes for us. Overall, we had a nice dinner at Hahm Ji Bach.

How have I not written a review about Hahm Ji Bach yet? This place is hands down one of my favorite Korean restaurants in New York (sadly, there aren't too many of them around here). The food and quality of service is definitely worth the trek out to Flushing from the city. If you're going by subway, it is not super convenient, but as the weather is getting warmer, the walk from the 7 really isn't too bad (you can also take the LIRR if you don't mind the extra $$). The banchan here is excellent, and the best part is that you get over 10 different kinds to try. Literally, your table is filled with banchan. The menu is also quite extensive, so there is a wide variety of dishes to try, whether you want a stew or noodles or BBQ, etc. On the last trip that we took this weekend, we opted to get two plates of meat and a hot casserole to share for three. Let me just say that I was surprised that this was actually too much food for the three of us, but it was.For BBQ, we opted to get a plate of the beef brisket and skirt steak. The beef brisket was quite fatty, but delicious. However, it was the skirt steak that really hit the spot. The meat was cooked to perfection, and I could have totally eaten another order of it if I weren't already so full / knew we still had a whole casserole left to go. Oh, you also get a steamed egg with your BBQ order (unless everyone gets it? I'm not really sure), and it was so fluffy and wonderful. I also highly recommend the regular samgyupsal (pork belly) or the pork belly with five flavors, as I have gotten those on previous visits.After our BBQ, we had the budae jeongol. Honestly, I had no idea how I was even going to be able to eat this at this point. I think I would have definitely enjoyed it more if I were eating this on an empty stomach, but it was still very good. They do not skimp on giving you a ton of things in the casserole (pork, spam, rice cakes, ramen, etc.) which makes it so great. However, I think if I were to redo this meal, I probably would have opted for a naengmyun for the group to share instead (perfect after BBQ and also smaller so that we didn't stuff ourselves). We ended up with enough leftover for a whole other meal.All of us were super satisfied after our meal.

The food is very good. The meats are marinated nicely. They are very soft and pretty much melts in your mouth. Ganjang gejang baekban which is soy marinated raw blue crab is fantastic.

I saw this place on yelp and the food pics looked great (boy was I deceived.) I went with my bf on Saturday 12/2 around 1:30PM to give it a try. It took about 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us, we were given menus and we decided what we wanted to get. There was two empty cups on the table; we didn't know who our waiter/waitress was. We decided what we wanted to eat; time passed but there was still no one to attend to us. There was an empty table next to us and the dark skin straight bangs, long hair waitress filled water in the cups and left a pitcher of water on the empty table, and then she walked away. Wow thanks for serving nobody and not us. Lindsay FINALLY showed up and took down our order after running around in circles like a headless chicken and ignoring us, we also asked for water (WHICH SHE NEVER GAVE US.) She did not even bother looking at our table to see how things were, yet instead went to do other things like give other people their bills and take their orders. We ordered corn muffins, the fatbird special with sweet potatoes fries and bacon cheddar waffles, and a chicken sandwich. Our corn muffin came, there was honey butter on the side, i did not taste an ounce of honey in that butter. Corn muffin was also very dry. After we ate the corn muffin, the hostess noticed my bf holding the empty glass cup because our WATER WAS NEVER FILLED and he quickly told someone to fill it. We also got the fatbird special, the fried chicken looked so dark like it was fried in day's old oil or never changed, so unappetizing. The pieces were so tiny and dry, the bird looked mal-nourished and to think I had to pay $34 for it. There was not much flavor in the chicken too. The sweet potatoes fries were probably the best thing I had that day, but how can you mess that up when its pre-made and all you need to do is fry it. The bacon cheddar waffles was bad, waffles soggy, and the cheddar on top did not go well with it, it was like a piece of plastic I could easily peel off. The chicken sandwich was ok, although the biscuit was falling apart when I was holding it. After we finished, I asked for the leftover chicken, biscuit and corn muffins to go. I clearly left a fork on that plate so I can use it to box up my food but I noticed that our waitress Lindsay took it away. She also gave us a box that was not big enough to fit everything, not to say that she did not give us a bag to go with it. Wow must not be logical to bring a bag along with the box. Now I need to use my hands to pick up my food to put into the takeout box. We asked for the bill and I went to the bathroom. On my way there, I was about to walk down the stairs when a waiter that was talking at the bar quickly turned backwards and walked into me, BUMPED ME AND ALMOST PUSHED ME DOWN THE STAIRS.

The waffle was really dry, no cheesy unctuous middle like would be expected, and her fried chicken looked way too dark and also a very small amount for the price. In the South we'd probably drag you behind our pickup truck for a country mile if you tried to serve that burnt bird to us for $25. \u00a0I couldn't believe that she didn't send her food back. The other friend got a burger, but nothing to write home about. All in all, a painful representation of the South.

Bright and spacious and beautiful, it beckoned us from its perch on the corner. It had a very inviting ambiance, and I am always a sucker for southern food. A friend had just raved about Queens Comfort to me just a few days before, so my stomach was primed. Raymond also LOVES hot chicken, so this looked perfect. Unfortunately, reality did not quite meet our expectations. For the price, there are definitely way better Southern food experiences out there (Peaches Hothouse, Clinton St. Baking Company, Sweet Chick). We ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and the Crab Hush Puppies ($16). While we were waiting, we looked it up online and realized it was owned by a celebrity chef - sigh. We also read a review that completely crushed Fatbird (with particularly nasty comments about the chicken) and we readjusted our expectations. The chicken wasn't as horrible as the review implied; the skin was pretty crispy and the chicken inside wasn't dry. The sauce was spicy and tasted multidimensional, but I didn't like that there was a pool of oily sauce that made the chicken soggy. Aside from the sauce, the fried chicken was pretty normal; I definitely prefer the Nashville hot chicken at Peaches Hothouse by far. For the hype about the biscuits, they were mediocre. Not particularly buttery or fluffy, they were just okay and I didn't really care to have more (and I am definitely a self-proclaimed bread lover). The crab hush puppies were actually really tasty; they were the perfect combination of crab and fried goodness, and they tasted quite luxurious. $16 for 5 is definitely an indulgence, though. That said, as I was writing my review online, my Ebates notified me that there's a 42% off groupon on Fatbird. In that case, I would DEFINITELY come here for the crab hush puppies and maybe try some of their non-fried chicken dishes since this held such promise. Overall, I would recommend coming here with a groupon but definitely not without. The place is beautiful and not crowded at all, so it's pretty easy to just walk in. The service leaves a little to be desired; the spicyness of the chicken was a little much for me, so I needed constant water refills. There were 4 servers hanging out at the counter folding napkins and chatting; it was definitely really weird because it looked like they weren't doing anything (not even sure if they were actually servers, but they were dressed like it). I didn't really get many water refills, so I would have to pause while eating to wait for water.

My chicken biscuit was a huge (and slightly dry) biscuit with a TINY fraction of a chicken strip on it. I ordered hot and it didn't have the slightest heat. Granted, it was only $9, but it was comical. The fried green tomato biscuit had a super thin and super soggy slice on it. It was basically a mush sandwich. The honey butter was super bland.

We didn't make a reservation but for a Sunday, late morning, we didn't have to wait for a table. Last time we ate in house and did so today as well. Again, the outside seating was full. My friend had a burger and a side biscuit, my other friend had the chicken and mac and cheese waffles, and I had a fried chicken, biscuit sammie. We ordered some drink specials, I had a whisky mule and when I finally got it, it was good. I say that because our waitress was VERY slow. The last time I visited, there was 1 waiter for the whole inside dining area. He was hopping but was very good. Today, there were 3 waitstaff for inside. Our waitress couldn't keep up, didn't bring our drink order until we were almost done with our meal. And then when we were just done, asked if we wanted anything else? We just got our drinks! It wasn't like there was a line of people, there were empty tables. Now the food. The chicken sammie was okay. The biscuit got soggy and fell apart. The chicken was good but nothing special and that's all you get, just the sammie, no sides. My friends burger was good and came with fries. The chicken and mac and cheese waffles were okay. It came with 3 pieces of fried chicken, a thigh, wing, and drumstick. The skin was crispy and the chicken juicy. The waffle came with a side of syrup. It mainly tasted like a Belgian waffle. You can feel the texture of the noodle but not really taste the mac and cheese. I've satisfied my curiosity and won't be back. In hindsite, for the the location? I'm surprised that it wasn't busier. A side note, the bathrooms smelled and the water didn't work well to wash your hands. If I had trouble as a patron? I wonder if the staff had the same problem? Also, it shouldn't matter, but the staff's attire stood out to me. The hostess was wearing tight pants and a tight, low-cut, crop top. Our waitress was wearing tight shorts over tights, and the other waiter was wearing dress pants, a white button down, and suspenders.

We were served two lunch chicken specials, no drink orders offered (had to chase someone down), menus left at the table, 30 minute wait for food, although the restaurant was empty at 2:30 pm on a busy holiday weekend, in the hopping Meatpacking District. All that, I could have ignored.But when the food finally came, the chicken was underdone. We each pushed through one piece each, but just could not keep going. Sometimes chicken is pink, even when thoroughly done. But the meat and skin were still sinewy, clammy and elastic. Clearly underdone. The host/manager's explanation was the meat is pink because the chicken is brined. He further stated that he \"didn't see any blood.\" Ummm, how many times have you seen chicken blood on raw chicken in the supermarket. Of course there was no visible blood. And I don't care how white or pink the chicken is, when the skin on my FRIED chicken wing is so rubbery that it refuses to break when pulled apart, that chicken is RAW.While the host with the neck tattoo did take both entrees off the bill for us, it was done with a lot of attitude. Rather than discussing it and at least pretending like he was interested in a customer's opinion/experience, he simply kept repeating \"I won't argue with you about this,\" as I tried to have a constructive dialogue as to whether or not this way of serving chicken is normal for and considered safe by the restaurant.

I stumbled upon Fatbird while going to the Apple store across the street and decided to have an early dinner there Saturday night. We were pretty hungry and asked how big the fried chicken biscuit sammies were and the waiter said some people can eat 2 of them if really hungry- not sure that is entirely true as the biscuits alone are HUGE. We shared a biscuit with honey butter to start and then each had a fried chicken biscuit and split onion rings. The biscuits are incredible and the honey butter is addicting. Not the BEST fried chicken I've had but I'm not a great critic as I don't eat it often. It's very plain with just 2 pickles so I added honey butter to it (is butter a carb?) and it took it to the next level. The onion rings were totally perfect as was the spicy mayo it came with.The price is a bit steep but what really shocked me was the fact that a cocktail is $17 a pop. I would absolutely never pay that much for a cocktail, regardless of the fact that I have lived in NYC for almost 7 years. Maybe it's just the neighborhood.

It is an amazing location and they have such good food and drinks options. Unfortunately the service and the food was just not good this past Friday (August 25) when we went. It took awhile for our server to come to our table once we got there. Finally when he came, I asked about the happy hour special. So then I tried ordering immediately since we had roughly 15 to 20 minutes left. He left and I am pretty sure he heard my speaking. That is quite rude in my opinion.We then waiting 10 minutes for him to come back and ordered very quickly. They were out of the first two beers I ordered - oh well, that happens. He recommended a beer that tasted nothing like he described. The biscuit we ordered came out fairly quickly - well it was completely dry and cold. I expected something fresh and warm where the butter would melt right away. Nope, I was wrong.The drinks then came 5 minutes after - it took forever for a beer and a cocktail?! Really? Im so used to getting my drinks first. He didn't apologize or seem to care. Then our mac and cheese came- again, I was literally so excited as mac n cheese is always amazing at southern restaurants. Well it was completely cold and since our waiter rarely checked in or came to our table, we didn't have a chance to ask for it to be warmed up. Then the pork belly came - I took one bite and that was cold. About 15 minutes later, we finally hunted our waiter down for the free second drink. Well at that point I was so sick of the food and just wanted to leave. We had to remind him that we needed our drinks. We quickly drank them and asked for the bill. So much for enjoying the ambiance in meatpacking and the food. The service just made the entire experience horrific. The waiter simply could care less about how we felt and we didn't have an opportunity to say anything. I really dont know if I want to come back or recommend this to our friends.

When I visited this place, there were about two hundred thousand people waiting for dumplings altogether. Somehow within that mass they were able to stuff about a thousand of those folks indoors while the remainder waited in a line out the door, out the block, out the damn borough. So you can imagine how it gets a little crowded in here. In all, it took about a couple of days for my position in line to move from DUMBO just before the Manhattan bridge to, finally, the interior of the place and up to the register. I don't necessarily mind the long wait, since I work remotely and I was able to get a lot done those two days, but I could see why the wait might be a problem for other visitors. I was able to step inside a little sooner than I thought because as someone was trying to leave, they shot out of the highly-pressurized dumpling restaurant with the velocity of a Renaissance-era cannonball, decapitating and instantly killing the person in line in front of me. Woo hoo!A word of warning, make sure you have a general idea what you want to order, and also be sure you have cash on hand, as they charge a minimum for card transactions. If you hesitate for too long on your order, or if you need to step outside to use the ATM, then it's back to DUMBO for you baby! Anyway, I stepped inside, and unfortunately for me a group of seven also tried to get into the place. You know the type, they've been waiting for a train for like ever, and even though there's clearly no room on the car they're going to stuff themselves in there anyway, holding the door open all the while and damned if we're gonna hold up anyone else's commute. Well, their group was about three too many for the max capacity of the room, so something had to give.As I was perusing the menu, I felt myself flatten under the weight and pressure of everyone else waiting for dumplings. I turned out okay and luckily I didn't lose my place in line, as a good Samaritan ahead of me assisted me in peeling myself off the floor like a cartoon character who just got bowled over by a steam roller. Turns out I'm now half a millimeter thinner than their menus!As I am now two-dimensional, it was a lot easier for the rest of us to move freely about the place. The staff at Vanessa's sure don't miss a beat despite the long lines out their door, so I was able to get my order surprisingly fast. Luckily I was able to escape the compressed restaurant before even more people tried to stuff themselves inside, compressing to the point of critical mass and creating a whole other universe aside the one you and I inhabit.I tried pork and chive dumplings, chicken and chive, and an order of fried pork buns.

The reason I gave 3 stars is because of the customer service and cleanliness. The place was really dirty. The floors had a lot of garbage, the tables were not clean and some areas had gunk. If the place looks like that, I can't imagine how the conditions are when they are prepping these dumplings. Second, when we were trying to order, the gentleman working didn't look at us or attempt to take our order. He told us to hold on. During the awkward moment, he was just looking for a cord to plug his phone into. Its hard for me to explain because you had to be there but it was very odd when the guy was talking to us, it felt like we were talking to a recording or robot.

The steamed red bean bun was cold as was the chive and egg pancake. The place was full of young white people with half of them being foreigners. I guess word gets out that it's cheap.

So a quick search for Thai in Hell's Kitchen showed me that I had Noodies already bookmarked (can't remember why) so we decided to go there.We showed up at 7 on a Wednesday and there were only two other tables dining. The place is pretty small but even so, it never got filled up. Maybe people were staying in instead of dealing with the aftermath of Stella? Not sure how it would look like on a regular day.To start, we went with their happy hour $20 carafe of sangria. Other then that, they don't have any other happy hour drink specials. You're better off just ordering a beer because the sangria didn't really taste like there was any wine in there. That or they put a boatload of sugar in it. Would not recommend.For an appetizer, we ordered the rock shrimp, which is basically just some fried frozen shrimp with spicy mayo. This was really basic, for lack of a better word. It's similar to what you would get from one of those chain restaurants when they try to do 'Asian-inspired' dishes.For my entree, I went with the Kea Mao (thin rice noodles, ground shrimp and chicken, egg, chili, bell pepper and basil leaves). I really enjoyed this. It was a nice change from the typical Drunken Noodles or Pad Thai I would normally order. Plus, they have this condiments caddy which has red pepper flakes, hot sauce, and pickled jalape\u00f1os. The pickled jalape\u00f1os paired well with the noodles - lots going on with this dish: sweet, spicy, and sour.They also have a sunset menu from 5 to 8 where you can get a select appetizer, entree and house wine or beer for $19.95. I'm not really sure how good of a deal that is because there's only about 5 appetizers you can select from and they all seem pretty basic - the standard dumpling, spring roll, etc. Nothing too exciting.I might be back for some of that Kea Mao, but with the number of other Thai restaurants in Hell's Kitchen I have left to try, it likely won't be anytime soon."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2017\n", "review": "It was a cold winter night and I was looking for a place to eat but every place I passed was so crowded because it was so cold.

The char siu pork was just so so, and compared to the last time I was there, the meat itself was rather plain. The only good thing was the ramen noodle, which was springy, chewy, and flavorful. I wish there was more of the noodle because that would help soak up the overly salty broth. I finished my bowl just because I didn't want to waste my money, but I wasn't really happy with what I got. I paid $18.00 (including tips) for a bowl of ramen and if it was phenomenal like last time, I wouldn't care to write this review.

One time I ordered the Kogashi Ramen and another time I tried the Spicy Black Garlic Ramen. They are both very flavorful and leaves me wanting more ramen. However, whenever I order ramen I always think I'm not going to have enough to eat and still be hungry, but I am always very full afterward. As much as I want to drink more of the broth, I try not to consume more than I \"need\" to while eating my ramen because it does taste quite a bit salty.Something I really like here though is that you are given the option to choose what kind of noodle you would like. Personally, I think that WAVY/FIRM is the way to go. I love wavy ramen noodles and firm gives the perfect amount of chewiness without too much bite. Price-wise, I think that it's comparable to a lot of the places in NYC, maybe a little higher than some, but nothing out of the ordinary for a bowl of ramen in major city.I think if you aren't going to other specialty ramen shops (i.e. places that people typically come to NYC to try), this is a very solid option"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "review": "This is my go to whenever I'm in the city.

The pork was nice and tender and not at all dismissive of its own flavors, specially with the fresh scallions, garlic scent and taste. Perfect with the straight noodles, their firmness brought the consistency I didn't think I needed. Paired with a cold Sapporo and you're in for a treat.

Here's the deal though: I used to go 2-3 times a week, not it's about 1 or 2 times a month and here's why:I don't love that they only take Credit Cards, that's a system stinks, I py by cash for almost everything, this is how I manage my money and keep my CC bills in check. \u00a0This policy of \"no cash\" only pushes our entire society more toward a global government/corporate takeover where they have tabs on what you spend and where. \u00a0It's very \"big brother/under his eye\" Sadly I won't be coming nearly as often as I did because of this. \u00a0It's literally become my almost last choice of vegan places to go.

That said, by Chloe does a really good job packing in not only enough salt, but spices and herbs as well into their foods to ensure that I'm eating what tastes like flour (ironically, probably the name of another vegan place) and feels like...flour. I got their The Sunrise (breakfast burrito), which, with a hefty side of their beet ketchup and spicy aioli, was a really nice-sized portion. The only part I didn't like was their was a significant amount of grease leaking out that made the overall meal feel heavy, but I'd rather that and have more flavor than the alternative. Price: I would say that this is on the upper end of the $$ label, just because we're not paying for any ambiance here and simply the food. That said, I would recommend coming here at least once.

Considering the amount of people in the store, the wait for food didn't seem too bad. I mean it was lunch time afterall. I was super excited to eat the salad when we got it but I had to make my way back to the office to have it. I was starving. My sister got back to her office before I made it back to mine and was already raving about how fresh it was and how delicious it was. Got back to my seat and digged right it. The salad is perfectly balanced with fresh lettuce and spicy chorizo. It is both sweet, spicy and fresh. The portion size is great and I had to eat slowly to finish the entire salad in one sitting though I probably could have split it to two smaller meals. Anyway, point is, it was super good that I wanted to finish it! Price of this salad was 13 after taxes but considering the amount of food you get and the quality of food, no complaints at all.

Perfectly breaded, just the right amount of sauce, white meat chicken. The burger was eh, which is where they lose a star. I ordered medium and it was well done. It was a bacon cheeseburger, but somehow the only flavor that came through was the bun? It was an extremely mediocre burger. It was large though. The fries were also just okay, under salted and nothing special. Also got one of their chocolate chip cookies which I loved because it was just a little under baked so it was gooey and warm. If you like a crispy cookie though, you won't like this. It was a lot of food, so I heated up half the burger and fries the next day. Burger remained largely the same, but the fries benefited going back in the oven and being sprinkled with seasoned salt.

I also appreciated the variety of food options they had, as we all had different things -- I had French toast, one friend had a burger, and another had a wrap. All of them were delicious by our standards, and very fairly priced. For the three of us, the meal came out to 25.04, which I don't think is too bad at all. My reason for giving it four stars is that when we walked in, we were not greeted or even really acknowledged -- just told to sit wherever. While that is common diner protocol, we expected to quickly be greeted by our waiter and asked what we wanted to drink while being given our menus. Instead, he was busy talking to his friends, so he didn't realize we walked in for about 5 minutes, and then once he did he handed the three menus all to me without even looking at us, still too busy talking to his friends to even say hello or make eye contact with us. He also never asked us what we wanted to drink, and only brought us water after our meals came out.

Now for the main courses (most important) we were a bit disappointed. Chicken tikka masala should be top notch at 'indian table' BUT the chicken cubes are dumped in the sauce per order so the chicken was not as tender and moist as it could be and didn't come with full flavor (so I was told because I'm a vegetarian). I ordered the vegetable Korma and the sauce was delicious but still couldn't mask the bland taste of the FROZEN VEGETABLES!!!! Frozen green beans, frozen carrots, frozen zucchini and frozen cauliflower :( I think from Trader Joes, haha! For an Indian restaurant they should pay a lot more attention to their vegetable dishes I would say (thinking emoji). Vegetables were bland and not marinated, grilled or sauteed before added to the 'stew'. Very lazy approach to indian cuisine in a restaurant setting.

Amazing flavor, hearty and delicious veggie balls, rich chunky aromatic sauce, phenomenal. Great naans, fluffy and chewy, garlic especially delicious without being too overpoweringly garlic-y.

Hopefully they do, because having good Indian cuisine is a must in every neighborhood.To my experience: Stopped in for a late lunch and the place was empty, which is a good thing and a bad thing. Good because it was quiet, bad because that meant they were about to close the kitchen for a break before dinner, so things were rushed and the food was probably prepared and sitting around all day.Prices here are on the high side for Indian cuisine, which would be fine if the portions were bigger, but to be honest it's not worth paying a premium for. Rice, overcooked vegetables, and chicken are not exactly expensive foods, no matter where you go. The pricing vs portions could definitely use some work.Anyway, looking beyond the prices, the food was spiced reasonably well for the typical American palate that doesn't understand spicy, which was a downside for me, but probably a positive for the locals, so at least it was flavorful. Having ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, I guess I should have expected mild. Though the bigger issue I had, is that the chicken was dry and hard, probably relating to my first point about it being the end of service before their break. Old microwaved food is never a good thing.Service wasn't great either, unfortunately. Being so empty one would assume more attention would be provided to the only table in there, though waiting for water was torture. Managed to get glasses filled while receiving the check... a subtle hint?After all this, I left with a stomach ache and felt crappy for the rest of the day. I'm going to point out that they opened with 110 points in rating violations and were left ungraded, according to the NYC Health website, so it's a bit troubling.

I cannot fault them for it since I would love to see them thrive as well but before getting there, they need to change the chef or their recipes. The beans, the oxtail, and the soup all have one ingredient in common. I could not place my finger or senses on what it was but it destroys the true flavor of all their dishes. The oxtail should have a semi sweet flavor to it and the beans should not taste like that, and the soup needs hearty vegetables and please figure out what spice/herb is being used that detracts from the flavor of all of your foods.

Not only is the food delicious and oh so flavorful, but the location itself is stunning, and looks like a southern mansion that will leave you in awe. Every detail is carefully thought through, and you can definitely tell. But enough about the vibe (even tho seriously, you should go just to check out the bar, sit at the counter and chat with Mr White himself ), let's move onto food shall we? Everything I've tried so far has been really good, but there's definitely a couple items that stood out. As an appetizer I'd recommend you to order the grilled oysters - the flavor is amazing and even if you don't like oysters trust me, you'll fall head over heels over these. Salty, flavorful, deliciously paired with the fresh slices of baguette served on the side. The shrimp beignets aren't bad either: crispy outside but soft and pillowy inside - \u00a0but between the two I'll always go with those oysters. As far as entree we tried the hot Nashville fried chicken, the blackened catfish, and the shrimp and grits. Let's start with the chicken: there should be a warming cause it definitely kicks a punch, so beware!!! You get to pick two sides and I'd def recommend you to get the Cajun Mac and cheese (creamy, with a very pleasant hint of spice), and the collard greens. I can't wait to go back and try the buttermilk fried chicken - maybe with the hot sauce on the side lol.The blackened fish was absolutely delicious. Flavorful, moist and flaky, and perfectly paired with greens and rice and beans - and a tartar sauce that I need the recipe for ahahah. It was so good! But to me, the piece de resistance was definitely the shrimp and grits. I'm a fan of the dish to begin with, but this elevated version was absolutely delightful. Buttery grits, topped with flavorful plump shrimps (with the heads!!! And that means sucking on them aka flavor town) and a blistered pepper. I loved that it kept the homey feel of the dish but gave it a great spin to make it a bit classier without compromising the familiar taste. I will definitely make my way there again - need to try the brisket for sure, as well as get my hands on those delicious oysters again."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "review": "Absolutely blow my mind and little bit of a hidden surprise.

Good service and good, short selection of wines by the glass. Although I would recommend coming here, not sure I will come back. Food is overall a little heavy and under seasoned for my taste. It's all good, just not amazing. We tried a good sampling of the menu, What we ate:Picnic potato salad; Hubby loved, I could leave it. Needed salt and I'm not so interested in it anyway. The Kale salad had a good mix of salty, sweet, crunchy n acid. The spice on the red beans n rice so good. Not sure what the greens were with the blackened catfish but they were cooked perfectly and were delicious (collards were too!).  \u00a0Fried chicken was priced right with 2 sides but needed spice, crust didn't stay on and the chicken was not so tender. Leon had an entire piece left over that didn't make it into our to go bag, bummer. Accidentally ordered the cauliflower Po boy thinking it was an app. Cauliflower was good but glad I didn't get this thinking it was Po boy. Big, white, starchy bread and the sandwich was mostly bread. We just picked the fried cauliflower off. Was tasty and very delicately coated and fried (not sure in what). Mac n cheese \u00a0was a stand out. The mustard sauce that we guess was for the chicken was also tasty!

It's a relatively new Sourthern-inspired restaurant in the East Village. The menu is rather limited and the food was wayyy over salted. It seems like they're trying very hard to recreate Southern cuisine in novel ways but it didn't work for me.We had a reservation and sat in the back at the \"Chef's counter\" which sounded really great but basically meant we were sitting at the back of the restaurant near the kitchen where the chefs shuck oysters. So maybe don't start there - I think it's the least decorated area in the whole restaurant. We ordered the char-grilled oysters which was their specialty and highly recommended by the waiter. I personally prefer raw oysters but gave it a shot because it was so highly recommended. We got 4-5 oysters COVERED in cheese and herbs, and a doused in a buttery sauce that filled the bottom of the plate. Did I eat grilled oysters or just consume a lot of cheese? Unclear. The dish was too cheesy and too salty and honestly a lot - I really should've gotten the raw oysters instead. For entrees, we had the \"Yellow rose of Texas\" which was a beef brisket and the braised pork cheek. The braise pork cheek was actually pretty good (and probably the only good thing we had here), while the beef brisket was a disappointment."}, {"star": 2.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "review": "I couldn't agree more with Rizzo H., after dining here it feels as if the reviews that are posted with 5 stars are likely from friends of the proprietor.The decor is fine but certainly not impressive.

We didn't have a reservation but live around the corner and decided to give Mr. White a shot after walking by and seeing it and reading a few of the good reviews. The evening began weirdly as the host told us 5-10 minutes for a table. We had arrived after the dinner rush so that seemed likely. Unfortunately, it was actually more than 30 minutes before we were seated. We had started off well with a nice glass of c\u00f4tes du rh\u00f4ne. It was difficult to hear one another or the server as the rap music (which I LOVE!!) was incredibly loud even by EV standards. We weren't staving so ordered a half dozen raw oysters, baby kale salad and the smoked duck entree to share. The oysters were shucked well but the mignonette was thin and didn't taste like much. \u00a0The kale salad was fine - small and nothing to write home about. Then the main event, the smoked duck. All the elements of this entree were strange and simply off. The duck was fatty and the flavor wasn't quite \"smokey\" - I'm not sure how I'd describe it.

The \"fries our style\" are actually more like potato chips with a cream cheese dip. Which is fine if that's what you want to serve but they should be described on the menu as such. The duck was fatty and lacked any flavor. The jambalaya also is not a traditional style. No sauce, not much flavor at all. \u00a0We doused in hot sauce to try and salvage. Then we realized that there were no crawfish tails in them, as described on the menu. The kitchen graciously sent out a plate of tails to make up for the mistake. I ordered a cigar city ipa and it tasted like a lager. I asked the server if there might have been an error and he said no, it was the IPA. Sure enough on the check it said lager. Had to ask to have the items we didn't order or sent back removed from the bill. All cld be more easily forgiven if the price point was lower but it came out to almost $150 for dinner for two with tip. \u00a0For that amount of money, I expect a lot more. Just really disappointed because I visit New Orleans often and LOVE the food there. \u00a0I live in the neighborhood and was really excited for this place to open.

For dinner we ordered the Nashville Style Hot Fried Chicken and the Blackened Catfish. The Nashville Style Hot Fried Chicken comes with a choice of two sides, I ordered Collard Greens and Corn on the Cob, I love spicy and this was perfect! The Blackened Catfish is served with mustard greens, red beans and rice making for a delicious and not so heavy southern meal. Both meals were paired with a great wine suggestion from our server!Thank you Mr. White, we will definitely be coming back to try more dishes on the menu!"}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "review": "If you're craving southern comfort food - but with a sophisticated twist, you need to make your way to Mr White as soon as you can. Not only is the food delicious and oh so flavorful, but the location itself is stunning, and looks like a southern mansion that will leave you in awe. Every detail is carefully thought through, and you can definitely tell. But enough about the vibe (even tho seriously, you should go just to check out the bar, sit at the counter and chat with Mr White himself ), let's move onto food shall we? Everything I've tried so far has been really good, but there's definitely a couple items that stood out. As an appetizer I'd recommend you to order the grilled oysters - the flavor is amazing and even if you don't like oysters trust me, you'll fall head over heels over these. Salty, flavorful, deliciously paired with the fresh slices of baguette served on the side. The shrimp beignets aren't bad either: crispy outside but soft and pillowy inside - \u00a0but between the two I'll always go with those oysters. As far as entree we tried the hot Nashville fried chicken, the blackened catfish, and the shrimp and grits. Let's start with the chicken: there should be a warming cause it definitely kicks a punch, so beware!!! You get to pick two sides and I'd def recommend you to get the Cajun Mac and cheese (creamy, with a very pleasant hint of spice), and the collard greens. I can't wait to go back and try the buttermilk fried chicken - maybe with the hot sauce on the side lol.The blackened fish was absolutely delicious. Flavorful, moist and flaky, and perfectly paired with greens and rice and beans - and a tartar sauce that I need the recipe for ahahah. It was so good! But to me, the piece de resistance was definitely the shrimp and grits. I'm a fan of the dish to begin with, but this elevated version was absolutely delightful. Buttery grits, topped with flavorful plump shrimps (with the heads!!! And that means sucking on them aka flavor town) and a blistered pepper. I loved that it kept the homey feel of the dish but gave it a great spin to make it a bit classier without compromising the familiar taste. I will definitely make my way there again - need to try the brisket for sure, as well as get my hands on those delicious oysters again."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "review": "Absolutely blow my mind and little bit of a hidden surprise.

Good service and good, short selection of wines by the glass. Although I would recommend coming here, not sure I will come back. Food is overall a little heavy and under seasoned for my taste. It's all good, just not amazing. We tried a good sampling of the menu, What we ate:Picnic potato salad; Hubby loved, I could leave it. Needed salt and I'm not so interested in it anyway. The Kale salad had a good mix of salty, sweet, crunchy n acid. The spice on the red beans n rice so good. Not sure what the greens were with the blackened catfish but they were cooked perfectly and were delicious (collards were too!).  \u00a0Fried chicken was priced right with 2 sides but needed spice, crust didn't stay on and the chicken was not so tender. Leon had an entire piece left over that didn't make it into our to go bag, bummer. Accidentally ordered the cauliflower Po boy thinking it was an app. Cauliflower was good but glad I didn't get this thinking it was Po boy. Big, white, starchy bread and the sandwich was mostly bread. We just picked the fried cauliflower off. Was tasty and very delicately coated and fried (not sure in what). Mac n cheese \u00a0was a stand out. The mustard sauce that we guess was for the chicken was also tasty!

Our table shared a bunch of char grilled and raw oysters which were a big hit. \u00a0I had the the vegan \"catfish\" - didn't know what to expect but it was SO good!

It's a relatively new Sourthern-inspired restaurant in the East Village. The menu is rather limited and the food was wayyy over salted. It seems like they're trying very hard to recreate Southern cuisine in novel ways but it didn't work for me.We had a reservation and sat in the back at the \"Chef's counter\" which sounded really great but basically meant we were sitting at the back of the restaurant near the kitchen where the chefs shuck oysters. So maybe don't start there - I think it's the least decorated area in the whole restaurant. We ordered the char-grilled oysters which was their specialty and highly recommended by the waiter. I personally prefer raw oysters but gave it a shot because it was so highly recommended. We got 4-5 oysters COVERED in cheese and herbs, and a doused in a buttery sauce that filled the bottom of the plate. Did I eat grilled oysters or just consume a lot of cheese? Unclear. The dish was too cheesy and too salty and honestly a lot - I really should've gotten the raw oysters instead. For entrees, we had the \"Yellow rose of Texas\" which was a beef brisket and the braised pork cheek. The braise pork cheek was actually pretty good (and probably the only good thing we had here), while the beef brisket was a disappointment."}, {"star": 2.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "review": "I couldn't agree more with Rizzo H., after dining here it feels as if the reviews that are posted with 5 stars are likely from friends of the proprietor.The decor is fine but certainly not impressive. I certainly didn't get the \"Southern Mansion\" feeling - Rather a DIY vibe - Taking a few urban outfitter elements and arranging them in such a way that, from afar, may look chic, but look too close and the reality is clear.We stopped by here for date night this evening. We didn't have a reservation but live around the corner and decided to give Mr. White a shot after walking by and seeing it and reading a few of the good reviews. The evening began weirdly as the host told us 5-10 minutes for a table. We had arrived after the dinner rush so that seemed likely. Unfortunately, it was actually more than 30 minutes before we were seated. We had started off well with a nice glass of c\u00f4tes du rh\u00f4ne. It was difficult to hear one another or the server as the rap music (which I LOVE!!) was incredibly loud even by EV standards. We weren't staving so ordered a half dozen raw oysters, baby kale salad and the smoked duck entree to share. The oysters were shucked well but the mignonette was thin and didn't taste like much. \u00a0The kale salad was fine - small and nothing to write home about. Then the main event, the smoked duck. All the elements of this entree were strange and simply off. The duck was fatty and the flavor wasn't quite \"smokey\" - I'm not sure how I'd describe it. The accompanying innovative cornbread side was far too sweet to compliment the duck and the coleslaw was flavorless.

The \"fries our style\" are actually more like potato chips with a cream cheese dip. Which is fine if that's what you want to serve but they should be described on the menu as such. The duck was fatty and lacked any flavor. The jambalaya also is not a traditional style. No sauce, not much flavor at all. \u00a0We doused in hot sauce to try and salvage. Then we realized that there were no crawfish tails in them, as described on the menu. The kitchen graciously sent out a plate of tails to make up for the mistake. I ordered a cigar city ipa and it tasted like a lager. I asked the server if there might have been an error and he said no, it was the IPA. Sure enough on the check it said lager. Had to ask to have the items we didn't order or sent back removed from the bill. All cld be more easily forgiven if the price point was lower but it came out to almost $150 for dinner for two with tip. \u00a0For that amount of money, I expect a lot more. Just really disappointed because I visit New Orleans often and LOVE the food there. \u00a0I live in the neighborhood and was really excited for this place to open.

There's also another location in flatiron and the same app applies for it. So. . . . the convenience of this little app is that I can have zero social interaction with any employee ever and order my meal and have it available for me at the exact time that I request. They've always had it ready and even have it sitting there to go a few minutes ahead of time. So on top of things in fidi. Go team go. I've only tried the bowl option so far. You can also get a pita or salad bowls. But I've tried the quinoa and the barley. Both are pretty good and really filling. I always make like 3 meals out of one of these suckers but I also load it on with all of the free stuff (which is a lot) and will get to in a minute. Next you pick a protein. My favorite of what I've tried is oddly the turkey mushroom meatballs. They're juicy and deliciously seasoned. Second favorite is oddly the chicken. It wasn't dry, super moist and above average for a fast food chain meal. The lamb balls are pretty decent and have a kick to them. The fallafel balls are a little dry and lack-luster. The worst was the steak. Which sounds heinous because it sounds like the best option but it was chewy and just not that great. Halloumi is all I have left to come back for . . . some day.What makes this a 5 star review is that I can pile on like 25 different side vegetables and condiments and the staff here doesn't (maybe) won't judge me. I love options. But some of my favorites are the cabbage and carrot salads, spiced chickpeas, grilled zucchini and tomato, feta, and fennel salads. Sauces I really like. . . well everything. Just everything. They even now have a seasonal pea hummus. But I can't not also get tzatziki, some roasted red pepper, spicy cilantro, tahini, and the charred baba ganoush. My bowl usually comes out looking like a painting.The first time I ordered it was a hodgepodge mess. I may have went overboard. The second time I ordered they skimped me on a bit and I think forgot half of my ingredients because I tried to get salad greens mixed in with the quinoa and there wasn't any salad. Third time I actually came in for the free promotion day and had to interact with a real person (sigh) and it actually turned out pretty perfect.

She says that there's no way to add gravy and I ask if there's by any chance a ladle in the back, because that sounds a little ridiculous for a kitchen. She begrudgingly goes to get something.

Whether she noticed or not, I let her know because free or not, no way am I consuming that drenched with water.

The employees were just sort of laughing about not having any forks and the \"manager\" did not even bother to come out and apologize. I had to go next door to pret and buy something else to get a fork there and eat my meal. Awful customer service and the food is OK.

I came in a little after 7 PM, only to find they were out of almost all of the proteins. Maybe half a scoop of chicken and about four lamb meatballs remained. I opted for the lamb, which was really the only good part of the dish. Many of the toppings, although free, don't add much flavor. The sauce options are similarly lackluster. The tahini dressing tasted like basically... nothing? No flavor at all. I love tahini, so this was a big disappointment. Service was similarly poor. Although there were at least three staff members in the restaurant, it took me about five minutes to be acknowledged by anyone. That acknowledgment came in the form of one staff member who I tried to speak to explaining that she was making herself her own meal and she would try to get someone to make me mine.

Both were great! \u00a0We finished the massive salad between the two of us & put a healthy dent in the serving of Eggplant. \u00a0We took the rest to-go (there was a good size portion left). \u00a0The Caesar was very tasty with lots of garlic. \u00a0The Eggplant was cooked just perfect with just the right amount of cheese & flavor but not too cheesy & just a bit crispy, which is always a favorite version I prefer of Eggplant Parmesan. I had a glass of Prosecco & Boo had a glass of Malbec. \u00a0We had attentive service at the bar & got served right away & were able to walk over to the next play & be seated all in an hour. \u00a0The takeaway we left at the adorable AirBnB we were staying at in the freezer. \u00a0The landlady is Italian & appreciated the serving we left her. \u00a0I can see where this could be a long dining experience especially with family & we were pleasantly surprised to get in, be served \u00a0& on our way.

Staff was disrespectful.First time I came here was for my birthday on a busy kind of night. A year later I really wanted to take my family here to celebrate Mother's Day.I understood online booking can be off sometimes. On Thursday evening, I was looking to book something for Saturday around 7PM. The day before Mother's Day. There were two available slots open but once I wanted to go ahead and book it, the time slipped away from me. Since I work in walking distance from the restaurant I decided to just show up in person in hope to get something worked out. *please excuse my language in the following message.1. The restaurant said it opens at 11AM, I waited until 11:05 AM to leave work and walk to the restaurant just because I know they have to open up and settle in. At least I thought so in my head. But once I arrived \u00a0there was a ton of staff in there but the inner door was locked and had a sign that said it was going to open at 11:30AM. I was anxious and annoyed. Don't say you open at 11 when you don't! Yeah it's only 30 mins but I don't have 30 mins to waste on a work day.2. I looked at the time it was 11:15 AM, I looked in again and saw a lady picking up calls. I'm like let me try to call and make a reservation. I tried 5 flipping times and it rang twice each time and hung up on me. 3. I saw a few people walking in and out another entrance so I decided to walk in there.. I mean it was about 11:25 AM 4. One worker said we aren't open until 11:30 AM, I'm like \"that's fine I just wanted to make reservations. And he directed me to the lady who was picking up calls 5. This beeetch was picking up reservations calls all along!!! She saw me waiting and paused to say to me \"ma'm we aren't open yet\" I said \"that's fine I just want to make reservations.\" This ass gave me such a nasty attitude with an eye roll and continue to pick up reservation calls. I'm like \"whenever you are ready, no rush\" but I didn't expect her to pick up 5-8 calls knowing that she had someone psychically fucking waiting 6. I was beyond pissed off and annoyed. The manager or worker there saw I was waiting for like 10 mins. He asked another lady to help me and take my reservation request. I said \"you know I called 5 times to make reservations before this and no one picked up.\" She's like \"she's the only one taking reservations\" but the funny shit is why my calls didn't go through or put me in a queue? That's some bullshit. So I'm like \"well okay I walked here from work and waited. All I want to do is make reservations\" this beetch rolled her eyes too and flicked her stupid ass nails and said \"okay. For what day\" I said \"I'm hoping to get a reservation for tomorrow for 7 people around 7 PM\" she's like \"we can't, tomorrow is all booked.\" IM LIKE IN MY FUCKING HEAD - YEAH BECAUSE THIS BEETCH NEXT TO YOU IS BOOKING ALL THESE OTHER INCOMING RESERVATIONS THROUGH THE PHONE. I was heated. She then said \"we can only do 9:30 PM\" I'm like \"sure I'll take that.\" Knowing that I would upset my father who has work at 11 PM and my brother who is traveling from PA. I only said yes because I told my mother how good it was here (at least for my birthday) and she was looking forward to it. If that lady wasn't too busy picking up calls she could had booked me at an earlier time. I'm pretty flipping sure because I heard her took a reservation for 7 and 8PM. 7. Listen, don't be flipping rude and don't be FLIPPING DISRESPECTFUL. I was waiting patiently and was being nice about how I just wanted to make reservations. I took the time out of my day to personally go to this restaurant and psychically make a reservation but they did not respect that at all and basically took 5-8 bookings in front of me knowing that I wanted to make reservations.

The service was mediocre, our server didn't recommend any food or have any great suggestions when we asked her questions.   We were warned food is served family style so order according. They really mean family style! Their portions are so huge and delicious!!! I was shocked. We got Chicken Parm with Pasta, Oysters, Ravioli and a Cesar salad. Everything was incredible. Served fast, homemade fresh flavors! We had so much leftover food we probably could have ordered one dish and it would have fed the four of us.

The delivery itself which is unrelated to this establishment was prompt and my food was nice and hot when I ate it. If I rated them on portions alone they would get five stars the portions say they serve 4-6 and they weren't lying. I ordered the clam with angel hair. Clams were relatively fresh. Noodles were super soft which I personally liked. The flavor was ok they didn't skimp on the garlic. I can't say I was blown away compared to my expectations when seeing this on yelp. Could be that I'm not dining in person. It also came with a giant loaf of bread like massive. The bread was ok nothing special. Will I go back to Carmine's when I come back to ny? Maybe but not likely. It was good but nothing spectacular. I've had better and I've had worse so if I had to rate it I would say it's average.

A quiet, chilled, laid-back atmosphere with all organic/natural sandwiches and snacks. A plethora of natural juices line the wall as soon as you walk in and multiple different variations on the ole coffee bean. I've had the Ice Matcha Latte and the Hawaj White Coffee, both of which were different and on point. It's a large space, minimalistic in design and furniture with free wifi in a somewhat lounge type feel with chill lounge music (though could be lowered just a tad sometimes) and dimmed lights. And the folks behind the counter are super friendly. Prices are within the Starbucks and other higher end coffee houses popping up ranges, but all and all, little extra is worth it to escape the crowds of your normal coffee/juice bar.

The soup dumplings are consistently delicious. The texture is not too doughy, giving a good dumpling wrapper to soup content ratio. The broth is flavorful, making you want to slurp and enjoy each dumpling slowly. The scallion pancake with beef is amazing. The somewhat crunchy texture of the scallion pancake partners well against the tender beef slices. The beef makes it a more filling dish than a regular scallion pancake. The soup was simple, light, and flavorful. The piece of shrimp you get in the dumpling in considerable, allowing you to get both the texture and taste of the shrimp.

The other Vietnamese restaurant we had seen turned out to be French.The Thai restaurant had only an $85 per plate prix fixe menu. Kung Fu appeared as a safe harbor in a storm. But...I wanted a main course with rice, and there are only 4 options on the menu. I ordered the curry chicken and was surprised to see it served with potatoes. Never before in my life have I been served a dish with potatoes in a Chinese restaurant. Surprise aside it was fine and not outstanding. My dinner companion wanted soup. Once again choices are limited/non-traditional and include a house spicy soup and several hot pot selections. My dinner companion chose the seafood hotpot and it was about 3 times the size of what she was looking for (which someone else might have been pleased with, but context is everything). Tea is charged at this restaurant, a pot of Jasmine tea to be shared was $6.

The zen plate came with bland kasha (buckwheat), but the brown rice that came with the sesame medallions at least had some sauce on it.

At first there was no one in the restaurant but a few minutes later, many more people trickled in. The decoration is very cute. They have their menu written on chalkboards, some are even in picture frames.Service: The waiter was very nice and brought us our menus. He asked us how our meal was halfway through it. We didn't have to ask for our glasses to be refilled. After our meal, he asked if we wanted dessert but we were all too full.Food: I got the Vegetarian Cutlet Parmesean which was a soy cutlet covered in cheese, over spaghetti, with a side of brocolli. It was very delicious meal. My other veggie friends got the Sesame Medallion Delight and the Macro Supreme Platter. The sesame entr\u00e9e came with teriyaki soy chicken, saut\u00e9ed greens, and brown rice which she thought was very delicious. My other friend did not like the macro platter as much since there was some kind of seaweed along with bbq tofu, brown rice, and variety of steamed veggies. All three of these dinner entr\u00e9es came with a salad of lettuce and shredded carrots, which was okay. The carrot ginger dressing that came with it was pretty good.

Ariel was extremely friendly and reasonable , he showed us all the packages with no pressure , even though we had one person over the max limit for the silver package $300 he still let us book it anyway, he was also able to workout issues with our promoter so admission wasn't charge , on average it's 25 bucks. What I like about this place is how big the stage is and how spacious VIP is. The bottles were brought right away , the waitress was sweet , and they always checked up on us. I liked the furniture and lighting there , felt like I was on a spaceship lol. The music was mostly reggaeton and bachata, which I didn't mind at all considering the awesome huge dancefloor , but they could of played more hip hop and top 40 hits. Also Toby love didn't hit the stage until like 3 am , which i think is misleading for those who show up just to see him . But I like how this place does brunch and sports events and live music from bands . Aside from the main floor, there are plenty of tables by the bar where you can have a drink or smoke hookah ( a jack and coke was only 11 bucks and it was strong AF). My reason for not giving five stars despite the great features is because the package was supposed to come with complimentary champagne and cake and they refused to give that to us until we paid the bill , it really was something that should've been given to us before hand . They also didn't give my friend any birthday shout outs which could've of been arranged . The bathroom was also kinda gross.

A popular Mexican group from the 90's was offering a show there. I purchased tickets for my parents, \u00a0my sister, my boyfriend and myself. I have been to La boom many times before but this was the first time I was going with my family. Doors were to open at 9 yet in reality they opened at 10. We waited for an hour in the freezing cold for them to open... which was very annoying. I immediately walked over to the wait staff to request to be seated in the VIP section and they told me I could sit at the table that I was requesting. When I walked back to get my family they told me that the table was reserved. I was outraged. I was the first one there! When I tried to complain the waiter told me that the table was taken because a bottle was already paid for and that since I hadn't purchased anything yet they had given the table to paying customers.We ended up taking another table but ended up getting treated very rudely by their incompetent staff. We ordered a bottle of champagne and were given a more expensive one. What completely pissed me off was that we were expected to pay for their mistake! I requested to speak to the manager but was denied access to him. Anywho... to make the long story short, the waiters are rude, the place is over priced ( we had to pay $100 just to sit in the VIP section and another $ 250 for their mistake.... and they included tip for the lousy service.) This place sucks... big time!We ended up buying three more bottles but the fact that they tried to make us seem like we werent paying customers pissed me off.

Most of the group got there at 10:30pm, am not sure if there is a discount since there wasn't anything going on inside at all and it was so early.The place is spacious and fills up quickly. My group had an area on the couches reserved. It felt like the Queens version of a latin Webster Hall. There was a very young crowd, girls with way-too-short-skirts and way too many latin guys with looong- well-kept ponytails. Is this the new trend? The place seems pretty unpretentious compared to what it sells itself as. Besides having the excessive 5 different checkpoints to enter (ID, guestlist, pat-down, payment window, coat check-no Coats allowed at all), people seemed to go there to dance and enjoy themselves, in couples and small groups.There was a good mix of music at the beginning of the night (merengue, bachata), but then a 1/2 hour later the DJ began playing Way-Too-Much techno mixed with latin. It was too loud, the songs were cut short, and the smoke machine was running way too much. Apparently the station on the radio DJ's from La Boom directly on Saturday's. I'd rather listen to my friend's mixes. The strippers/go-go dancers were entertaining because they were so corny. The girl and guy were on separate pedestals in the middle of the dance floor, everyone ran to watch them. Guy started out in a cop costume- barf. The midget in an elf costume that got up on the pedestal behind our couch was a little too much. I hope he gets paid well. At least he seemed to be really into latin music drowned out by techno.

The scallops were perfectly cooked with a huge dollop of uni on top, the skirt steak was tender and seasoned well, but I must say my favorite dish of the night was the goat cheese and beat salad. All the elements of the salad really came together and complimented each other, where it leaves you wanting more. Would recommend it 10/10."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "2/2/2017", "review": "Finally tried this place after years of neglect. I live very close by, so it really should not have taken so long. It is easy to miss when walking up and down 7th Avenue, so you have to be on the lookout. A place with standing room only, Bar B has a fairly decent wine selection, and a few beers, but the star is really the food. You'll probably gaze in wonderment how cheap everything on the food menu is. However, it really is only like 2-3 bites of food. Yet, those bites are all really tasty. We got the steak, the fried chicken, and the octopus. The octopus was chopped up, but still very tender, and the crunch of the vegetables it came with was a good contrast to the slightly chewy octopus. The fried chicken was tasty, and came with the sauteed scallion on top, but was pretty much like 2 small chicken fingers. The steak was probably the best dish of them all, as it was a perfect medium rare, and was likely the most filling out of all dishes. That being said, everything was pretty well-executed, and again, while you might not feel completely satiated by the end of everything, it is all very tasty.Service is pretty attentive, since it's such a small place, but sometimes you need to wave them down if you want a refill on your drink. The prices, again, are pretty low for food, which allows you to try a lot of different things, but remember that you do get what you pay for. Definitely worth it during happy hour prices, but perhaps just decent value at other times.Overall, a solid place for casual drinks and small snacks. It's a little hard to stay longer than an hour and a half, as you have to stand the entire time, but still a pretty good spot to catch up with a friend. I'll have to try a bit more off the food menu next time I'm there, as well as the other wines available."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2017", "review": "Love this place!

The entire place is one long bar that wraps around the register, serving area, and kitchen with no chairs but plenty of hooks to put your things. The whole place could probably hold 12 people max. When i came in on a Monday night with a friend, the place looked fairly full but we were easily able to find a spot somewhere in the back near the kitchen area. We originally planned on staying for just a drink and going elsewhere for dinner, but the food smelled so good we changed our minds, and were glad we did. I ordered the rich and heavenly mushroom and prosciutto pasta dish, while my friend ordered the wonderfully seasoned ribs with fries. Given that these are described as Tapas, the portions weren't huge but i was still feeling pretty full after my meal. Definitely coming back to try the Uni (sea Urchin) dishes. Tips:- standing near the kitchen area gets very hot so choose your placement wisely- be prepared to wait a bit for your food. the small space only allows for 1 chef and a small kitchen setup- Happy hour is from 4pm-7pm - $5 glasses of house rose, white wine and red wine, and $4 for a certain beer- check the blackboard for a large list of specials that aren't on their standard menu.

This is the spot, the stew chicken was clean, there was no skin on the chicken so you could tell the chef spent a considerable amount of time trimming excess fat and cleaning off the skin. My food came with a side of vegetables, fresh garden salad, stew chicken and choice of yellow rice n peas or spinach rice. I could tell the yellow rice was cooked with wholesome clean ingredients probably from actually saffron to color (not sazon loaded with sodium). This was a true trini meal and I am ecstatic to try all the other dishes that are prepared based on the day of the week. They need to change their sign from Juice Bar and Health food and let pedestrians know they sell caribbean food as I feel this would drive so much more people who are not caribbean to this restaurant.

I'm unsure if something is different on their end, or if this is just a coincidence, but we never had such problems until the last few months.It seems almost every time we order there is either something missing, or the wrong item was included. Usually it's little things - we pay the little bit for extra dipping sauce for a calzone but don't receive it (or the free one it's supposed to come with); we select garlic knots as the complimentary item when ordering a pasta dish, but just get plain Italian bread; a salad goes missing from the order; etc. I'm certainly not going to ask them to redeliver an order of free garlic knots or missing sauce, but the frustration does add up."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "5/20/2015", "review": "Since moving to Harlem from NJ, Pizza Stop has been my go to for good pizza.

The delivery guy was friendly enough and everything was correct with the order. The chicken parm sandwich was the best of the meal with a hearty bread, zesty tomato sauce and well seasoned chicken. The calamari was a bit over fried and the breading was a bit heavy, more like a mozzarella stick than calamari. I am always too afraid to say \"well fried\" or \"lightly fried\" to places since if it's too fried its not great and if it's under fried it's too squidy for me.The pizza slice was just average. It wasn't under cooked but for something so saucy like BBQ and then heavy like chicken chunks it needed to be a bit more cooked or a stiffer dough to hold everything up. The flavor was also lacking and the chicken wasn't very hot.

The duck wings were good but a little too salty for my taste, however my fiance and friend both loved them. The mushroom melange was probably my least favorite dish as they were a little bland -- healthy though! For the meaty stuff we got the roast duck and short ribs, both w/ egg noodles, as well as dry-aged burger buns. All of these were sooo good. The first two had kind of a small-ish portion, but still really good, and the short ribs just melt in your mouth.

Walked in on a Thursday around 8:30pm with a friend, and the place was pretty empty. Unlike the classic, no frills restaurants in Chinatown, this place was cute, with neon pink lighting, green pastel accents, and brick walls. While the prices were steeper than basic Chinese restaurants, they weren't unreasonable, and the wine was especially affordable compared to most NYC restaurants. We were disappointed to discover that they had run out of their namesake dish, char sue, which we had both wanted to try, so decided to order a bottle of red wine and the following: Green Papaya Salad: salt and pepper shrimp, red curry, and tofu skin; the portion size of this was kind of small, but it was light and refreshing; the fried shrimp had soft shells, making the entire thing edible without peeling; I've had better papaya salads and would probably pass on this the next time aroundFive Spice Short Ribs Mantou Sandwich: braised with daikon, onions, chilies, and garlic; served on a soft bun with mint, basil, cilantro, lettuce, mayo and chilies; the braised short ribs in this sandwich was very flavorful and the mix of ingredients in the soft bun balanced each other out well; would recommendRoast Duck: rubbed with Sichuan spices, served with fresh herbs, fris\u00e9e and pickles with choice of egg noodles or rice; we decided to get this over egg noodles, which were a bit oily, but cooked well; the portion size of this was good and the duck was tasty, but I've had better in ChinatownChocolate Cloud Cake: with coriander and passionfruit ice cream; this may have been my favorite dish, as the chocolate cake was rich and delicious and paired well with the sweet and fruity ice creamOverall, the food was good, but wouldn't say it rivals some of the basic restaurants and food stalls in Chinatown.

The pho was good - it wasn't mindblowing or anything, but it had some decent flavor to it. I ended up adding the chili sauce from the table into it and that was my favorite part of the meal.Next time I do want to try the 5 Spice Short Ribs, as there seem to be many good reviews on the dish.

So my bestie and I decided to give it a whirl. Boy oh boy... were we glad we did!Bonnie was amazing from when first walked in and wasn't ready to \"yes to the plate\" just yet. At first we were the only table and there were some gentlemen seated at the bar. She clearly explained everything to us and gave us the time to figure things out. We decided on the sharing plates and vegetables. They were Shrimp Summer Roll, Monkey Bread, Five Spice Duck Wings, Crispy Brussels Sprouts (OMG never have I ever experienced Brussels Sprouts this dang GOOD), Broccolini and Nigori to drink.Shrimp Summer Roll: avocado, chinesse celery, cilantro, carrot, ume vinaigrette ($10)- very tasty light and refreshing with an amazing vinaigrette that isn't too over powering. Monkey Bread: freshly ground thai green curry, roasted sweet potato ($12)- the sweet potato under the bread is a nice touch to prevent premature sogginess. However, the highlight of this dish is the thai green curry sauce/broth. You will literally be licking the bowl. Five Spice Duck Wings: plum sugar glaze, cucumbers, scallions, sesame (Happy Hour $6)- H/H is until 7:30 and this portion comes with 2 wings. Great flavor profile, sweet and salty but not over bearing. Crispy and saucy skin with very tender meat. Crispy Brussels Sprouts: nuoc cham, peanuts, chilies ($8)- FREAKING AMAZBALLS... So dang good we ordered it twice. I do not know what they did to this veggies but whatever it was, it was Amazing!Broccolini: charred, pumpkin seeds, soy ($8)- ok people, idk what they do to vegetables here but they do it very well. Another wonderful dish, with great flavor. SHO Chiku Bai, Junmai Nigori ($6)- explained as a cloudy form of sake ... Wasn't a fan only got it bc of my name.Clearly I had and enjoyable meal and look forward to returning. I will be ordering serval of the same things again like those Sprouts.

It's a very casual spot, with table service, a bar you can eat at, or a grab and go counter at the front. The first pleasant surprise was when we found out that we had made it in time for their happy hour, which goes til 8pm and offers lots of drinks and food items at $3-5 - a great deal! From that menu we got the pooty fries with the five spice short rib, which was my favorite dish of the meal. The short ribs were amazingly flavorful and tender, and next time I'm definitely going to get the full order of them over rice or noodles. The other dishes we had were also mighty tasty for the most part. We really liked the lamb in Japanese curry over rice, as well as the broccolini side dish. We weren't fans of the Japanese eggplant, simply because they were far too salty and a bit mushy. The ambiance is brightly lit and perhaps a tad too casual for a romantic date, but perfect for an easy meal with friends or on your own. Everything came out really quickly and was hot and fresh. Prices are pretty reasonable too, depending on what you get. I have to admit I'm curious about their full Peking duck dinner, which they say feeds 3-5 people and costs $150. A perfect location near the Essex stop, and lots of other bars to drop into for a drink before or after.

(PS - If you can't think of one, it's probably you.)The roast duck with noodles is my newest obsession. Why is the duck so good?? The portion is just right, although I wouldn't mind just a teeny bit more noodles. The duck is juicy and tender and the skin is crispy, fatty, and flavorful. It's similar to roast Peking duck, but elevated somehow. Also, the daikon salad is a nice starter. Sweet, tart, salty, and refreshing at the same time. I'm eager to try the other items on the menu, although I'll probably order the duck a few more times before I move onto anything new.

We ordered the duck wings and lamb curry rice as appetizer and shared the roast duck rice. Duck wings are pure deliciousness! It is being boil marinated and fried to take out the excess moisture on the outside, but still Kept the meaty juice in. Lamb curry fried looks simple but would makes you speechless after the first bite as you will be nonstop eating it. They did a wonderful job with the combination of lamb and curry, each ingredients compliment well with each other while the fries just soak in all the good flavor. As for the roast duck rice, I would say it is quite impressive and creative. For those of you who are familiar with Cantonese cuisine, you should know that roast duck rice plays a huge role in the culture; and For a good roast duck, it has got to have a crispy skin outside but juicy meat underneath. Not only did they do it right, the garnishes and the mint leave really brought it to another level. The heavy duck meat taste got balanced out very nicely by the mint leave and the yuzu soy sauce they poured over the rice.

The monkey bread was SO good-- soft bread sitting in a coconut lemongrass sauce. The bread was buttery and had salt crystals that balanced the dish! I devoured it! The lettuce wraps were on the happy hour menu and only $3. They had a delicious pork sausage and was a great light snack to start. The eggplant was flavorful and had chunks of roast garlic that I did hesitate to scarf down. The papaya salad was a little different than most in that it came with a curry sauce that you poured on yourself. It was crunchy and fresh. The main course was awesome! The short rib was tender and broke apart with the touch of the fork. The extra noodles were a must because my husband and I fight over noodles when we share dishes. We each got a good share of noodles soaked in short rib juice! Fresh herbs top every dish which I love. My Yusuf drink was light, not too sweet.

My friends loved their duck and pork dishes, but as a vegetarian I had to scramble to put together a filling meal, and it wasn't worth the price point. There is one appetizer ($12 monkey bread) and two vegetable side dishes ($7 broccolini or brusse sprouts) that are vegetarian. I ordered the monkey bread to share, and the broccolini with an egg and egg noodles. The broccolini came out with the first appetizer, while the noodles and egg came out with no explanation a solid 20+ minutes later, as the main meat courses arrived. The monkey bread was delicious, but since it was nearly the same price as a main we assumed it would be large enough to share. Instead, it was a muffin-sized plain monkeybread, with a small piece of tender sweet potato and a layer of curry for dipping. It was delicious, but no more substantial than the other small plates. The broccolini was great, but the long stalks made it awkward to eat without a knife (don't order on a date or business meal). The egg noodles were served in a sort of broth, which isn't mentioned on the menu. By the time they arrived I couldn't ask what the broth was without my friends feeling extra-bad about bringing me here, so I just told myself it was vegetarian and enjoyed it. The service was friendly but super slow when it came to paying. We weren't in a rush, and when he finally returned from the back with our cards the server mentioned some trouble with the card reader.

We sat on high chairs and wanted to order everything from the menu! Small menu, which I like, the less you have, the better and fresher the food tends to be.

We wanted to try all the main menu flavors, so we ordered 2 main dishes and 1 sandwich (and that's why we started off with a sandwich!)...We had one of the pork flavor on a sandwich and it was AMAZING. It reminded me of a bao meets banh mi. We loved it. The white fully cloud like bread was delicious. The meat was perfectly seasoned, the spices were on point! We chose our main dish to be the other pork dish (5 spices I believe) with rice and the duck with egg noodles. OMG. The flavors were unbelievable, like nothing I ever had before. It was perfect, just perfect. The pork was fantastic. It had so many layers, the juices and sauces are what dreams are made of. The duck was excellent.

Warning: it is super spicy but it's the kind of spiciness that makes you crave for more. Aside from that, we also got the Brussels sprouts, mapo pork belly, and the duck with noodles.

Needless to say, when the opportunity came to revisit Char Sue for a five course dinner menu, I immediately said yes.The restaurant is conveniently located just steps away from the Delancey-Essex stop in the LES, and is set up for diners and groups of all sizes. Looking to just grab a quick bite? Take a seat at the bar or one of the two tops to the side. Hoping to have a group of friends and family? There's a communal table that'll seat everyone at once as well. It works for almost any occasion, and the food alone is deserving of a special visit.Dinner began with a new menu addition: Monkey Bread served a top a slice of sweet potato in a Thai Green Curry. The bread is a family recipe, compliments of Chef Matty Rojas, and is soft and pillowy with no small amount of butter - perfect for getting that slight crisp at the bottom of the bed. It's the perfect vehicle for scooping up the spicy and creamy curry, and contrasts well with the sweetness of the sweet potato. The following dish isn't, unfortunately, on the permanent menu, but if I had my way - it would be. Tender, succulent slices of octopus were served with charred brussels sprouts and paired with a spicy pennywort vinaigrette. The flavors were reminiscent of the Yu Xiang (\u9c7c\u9999) sauce that I've grown up eating, and was the perfect savory-spicy flavor for the protein.Next up: Crispy. Pork. Belly. No other words are really necessary, but I did my best to savor each of the three pieces that were served; they had a crisp, crunchy crust that yielded to a tender and fatty interior, and was highlighted even more with the side of a garlic-chili dipping sauce. It ties with the Char Sue Duck as my favorite dish of the night, but how can you compare to a plate of decadent dry-aged roast duck coated in a blend of Sichuan spices? A crisp, crackling skin, tender and juicy white meat, all served a top of bed of warm sushi rice... this would easily be my last meal (if I ever had to choose one) and is more than successful as a modern, elevated take on the traditional Peking duck.To finish, a sweet almond pudding with a strawberry jam provided the ideal light finish to the meal... and also cemented my desire to camp outside their kitchens for the remainder of my time. (You think I'm joking. I'm not.)I'm already planning a return visit to Char Sue, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a uniquely NYC restaurant.

The Sprial Tap was so good it makes me want to order vegan options on the regular. It has caramelized onion and a house marinara. Though it doesn't have the vegan cheese, I'm still a fan of it and need to venture out and try more off the vegan menu next time. They have 6-8 tables and a great happy hour special.

The food was always just ok and the service was adequate. I mostly frequented the restaurant due to its location across the street from Marine Park and the fact that my friend lives within walking distance. It's a convenient place for us to meet. We met there last night with a group of several people. My friend avoids gluten and asked if they had rice noodles. The waitresses told her they only had udon and soba and I confirmed to my friend that these noodles contained wheat. The waitress then told her that soba has wheat and udon are rice noodles (untrue!). The restaurant would be liable if she ordered the udon and had a bad reaction. The waitress also shared (unbidden) that she eats soba twice a day and is just fine. We asked about substitutions in the bento box and were told that no substitutions were allowed. My friend and I decided to eat light and had sushi salads and a roll each and the men ordered bento boxes. The food was ok, although I have never been impressed with the quality of the sushi at this restaurant. When were dividing up the bill, my friend noted that our costs were exactly the same. While I was happy to split the bill, my salad was actually $6.95. No matter the minor difference, I insist on being charged the prices on the menu. I asked to see the menu and was given a paper menu which showed the price of my salad as $7.95. However, I didn't order from the takeout menu. I asked to see the regular menu and I correctly recalled that the price was $6.95. I was told that the price had changed but they couldn't change the regular menu. However, they would take off the $1 to accommodate me. That's no accommodation, that's the law. They knew very well that they are charging more for some items than is listed on the menu. We were also charged $1 apiece for green tea. I have never paid for green tea at this restaurant or any other Japanese restaurant in the United States. While we were shown that the menu indicates a $1 charge for green tea, I would never have thought to check the beverage prices as green tea is always included and I didn't want any other beverage. As we weren't told about the charge, I thought it should have been deducted. As they refused to do so, the charge came off the tip. While we are always generous tippers, the rude attitude and deceptive practices left us no choice. I note that another poster recently had a similar experience. There are many excellent Japanese restaurants in Brooklyn and we will go elsewhere from now on.

We like sushi and eat it a lot so we've tried all the spots on Avenue U. Sakura is by far the superior to them all.The Food: Delicious, fresh and large selection. Don't like sushi? They have a ton of beef, chicken, fish, shrimp and other seafood platters and dishes. I recommend the BBQ Squid which comes grilled and tender with a dish of delicious gooey sauce which I would drink if I could. Fried calamari is also good, but filling watch out, save room for sushi. They're appetizers are fun to explore, these are mostly small so ask how many your table will need. I would highly recommend eating in the restaurant as this type of food needs to be enjoyed right as it leaves the kitchen. Presentation of food is top notch as well.The staff: Super friendly and accommodating. No matter what your request is they will promptly rush to make you comfortable. Extra ginger/wasabi for the sushi? No problem. Hot tea? Refill? No problem. They always smile and carry themselves professionally. We always get a barrage of goodbye's from the staff and kitchen as we leave the restaurant.Price: For sushi this place is not expensive. It's Brooklyn prices. In Manhattan you'd get half the amount of food for double the price. We often have large parties of 8-10 here and the bill usually comes out to around $350-450. For 10 people that's about $45 per person.Have been coming here for probably 5 years now, won't stop any time soon. :)Their front door is locked for whatever reason, so you have to go around the back and enter from the parking side."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2014", "review": "Great food.at reasonable prices.

However, the chef takes great pride in his food, the service is attentive, and I know I can always come here for a reliable dinner.What stands out at Tramonti are their specials. Whenever we pop in, we're hoping to try something new. Once, I had a duck pappardelle that was so warm and rustic that it tasted like home, even though I am not at all Italian and have only once been to Italy. Sadly, I haven't run into it on the specials board since. Their rotating series of special gnocchis are also absolute gems. The gnocchi they use in their specials is a softer, pillowier gnocchi than they use on their regular menu; it holds its shape, unlike most ricotta gnocchis, but still retains an excellent bite.

I'm so glad he reached out because the second time around, I not only had a better experience, I also got a history lesson on Giovanni's family, his hometown, Tramonti (located in the Alfami coast), and how he got into the restaurant business. To give the menu a fair judgement, they had selected a pasta and pizza for us to share. The pizza was the calzone filled with mozzarella and spicy soppressata, while the pasta was their traditional gundi made with ricotta instead of potato. But before that, we had a bread basket to start - the bread is sliced per table, which I love as it keeps the freshness of the bread. The bread as I remember the first time was great - perfectly soft and delectable. We shamelessly ate two of these baskets.When the calzone arrived, our first thoughts were \"that thing is massive!\" From the first time, I remember enjoying the extra doughy crust, which was still the case for this calzone. The first cut into the calzone had sauce oozing out, which was fantastic when you dipped the crust into the sauce. The real highlight though was that mozzarella - Giovanni informed us that this is imported from his neighbor in Tramonti and how it took several months convincing his neighbor to sell him this cheese. Let me tell you, those months paid off as you can really taste the superior quality in this mozzarella. Not only is it extra stringy (this of those cheese pull instagram pics), but it just tastes better than the other mozzarellas. The spicy soppressata was actually pretty spicy too, which I also enjoyed. Super filling - this calzone can easily feed two. Despite being full from the calzone, the gundi arrived - thankfully it was a small dish filled with 10 large pieces. It's baked with beef ragu and then topped with mozzarella. Since it was made with ricotta, the gnudi felt so light and fluffy - coupled well with the beef ragu. Make sure you keep some spare bread for the sauce. The sauce is made from JUST tomatoes alone, delicious. Just when we thought our meal was complete, Giovanni asked if we trusted him to bring out a surprise dessert. Out came what looked like a chocolate cake, but when we took a first spoonful, it definitely wasn't a cake. It was dense and a little hard to take apart - definitely unique and unlike anything I've had. At the end we were told that it's a traditional Tramonti dessert that was eggplant and chocolate. I would have never guessed that this was made from eggplant! It's no wonder I've never seen this dessert before. After sitting down and chatting with Giovanni, you really can sense the passion that he has for his cooking and his beloved Tramonti (restaurant and city). I'm so grateful that we were able to give this place a second chance. Oh and their menu changes every 3 months, so if you live in the neighborhood, this is a major perk for you. And they now have their liquor license, so they'll be Tramonti wine for you to try.

The texture was dissimilar to a typical NY slice, and though I personally prefer a crispier slice, this was great.The highlight (for me) was a spicy oil that they gave to put on the food (I forgot the name, or rather, I didn't comprehend and was too nervous to ask for clarification). It was great.As someone who enjoys spicier foods, this added a nice spice. As an oil-based (I assume) substance, it lacks an initial kick, but it slow-burns in your mouth.

Orechiette ingredients were good and tasty, maybe bit salty but overall good. Paccheri was bit more dissppointing, nothing really special and I found the tomato sauce too sour for my taste that mixed with the sorpressata was too strong for me.

I also ordered the sesame and beef pancake, however it was too bready and not enough filling. They barely gave any picked veg with it.

When I visited this place, there were about two hundred thousand people waiting for dumplings altogether. Somehow within that mass they were able to stuff about a thousand of those folks indoors while the remainder waited in a line out the door, out the block, out the damn borough. So you can imagine how it gets a little crowded in here. In all, it took about a couple of days for my position in line to move from DUMBO just before the Manhattan bridge to, finally, the interior of the place and up to the register. I don't necessarily mind the long wait, since I work remotely and I was able to get a lot done those two days, but I could see why the wait might be a problem for other visitors. I was able to step inside a little sooner than I thought because as someone was trying to leave, they shot out of the highly-pressurized dumpling restaurant with the velocity of a Renaissance-era cannonball, decapitating and instantly killing the person in line in front of me. Woo hoo!A word of warning, make sure you have a general idea what you want to order, and also be sure you have cash on hand, as they charge a minimum for card transactions. If you hesitate for too long on your order, or if you need to step outside to use the ATM, then it's back to DUMBO for you baby! Anyway, I stepped inside, and unfortunately for me a group of seven also tried to get into the place. You know the type, they've been waiting for a train for like ever, and even though there's clearly no room on the car they're going to stuff themselves in there anyway, holding the door open all the while and damned if we're gonna hold up anyone else's commute. Well, their group was about three too many for the max capacity of the room, so something had to give.As I was perusing the menu, I felt myself flatten under the weight and pressure of everyone else waiting for dumplings. I turned out okay and luckily I didn't lose my place in line, as a good Samaritan ahead of me assisted me in peeling myself off the floor like a cartoon character who just got bowled over by a steam roller. Turns out I'm now half a millimeter thinner than their menus!As I am now two-dimensional, it was a lot easier for the rest of us to move freely about the place. The staff at Vanessa's sure don't miss a beat despite the long lines out their door, so I was able to get my order surprisingly fast. Luckily I was able to escape the compressed restaurant before even more people tried to stuff themselves inside, compressing to the point of critical mass and creating a whole other universe aside the one you and I inhabit.I tried pork and chive dumplings, chicken and chive, and an order of fried pork buns.

And yes, they were right. We ordered the pan fried pork dumplings and the pork sesame buns with a side order of the chili oil. All were very very good. The reason I gave 3 stars is because of the customer service and cleanliness. The place was really dirty. The floors had a lot of garbage, the tables were not clean and some areas had gunk. If the place looks like that, I can't imagine how the conditions are when they are prepping these dumplings. Second, when we were trying to order, the gentleman working didn't look at us or attempt to take our order. He told us to hold on. During the awkward moment, he was just looking for a cord to plug his phone into. Its hard for me to explain because you had to be there but it was very odd when the guy was talking to us, it felt like we were talking to a recording or robot. It was very unwelcoming.This stuff rarely bothers me but crap..if you want our money, be courteous and act like you care."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "review": "Always glad this place exists when I'm in the East Village and hungry.

Their housemade chili oil is especially excellent, and their vegetable dumplings are so full of fresh vegetables that you can almost pretend they're healthy. You can also buy cheap bags of frozen dumplings to take home.The place is always busy, so it can sometimes take a while for them to make your order, but it's well worth it.

Not sure why it showed up since it did not have any. However, decided to try it because of the numerous reviews and the high ratings. I ordered a ton of stuff. Fried chive pork dumplings, fried pork and cabbage dumplings, wonton hot spicy sauce, pork fried buns, steamed red bean buns, pancake with Peking duck, pancake with roast pork, noodle with meat and bean sauce, green apple tea, strawberry green tea and almond smoothie with lychee and a chive and egg pancake. All added up to just $35. The best thing had to be the wontons and the sesame pancakes. The drinks were excellent too. However, the dumplings were just ok. The steamed red bean bun was cold as was the chive and egg pancake. The place was full of young white people with half of them being foreigners. I guess word gets out that it's cheap. Then I was a little freaked out by the Family of druggies who came in to use the bathroom. It was about 9 on a Monday night and the place was packed.

Nothing glamorous and totally fine.I have tried every dumpling here and can confidently say that they are all excellent. Order whichever meat you personally enjoy the most as they are not known for one specific dish or anything here: all is good.Their other options are satisfactory, but not amazing. However, if you are in the mood for clean, Asian flavors, it hits the spot.In addition to their dumpling varieties, I've had the Wonton noodle soup and Peking duck sandwhiches which were both pretty tasty.

No. Was it worth the price? Absolutely. Super fast, terrible service (sorry, that's what happens in Asian restaurants. In and out guys, in and out.) my whole meal was 5 bucks for a light lunch.

What is happening here is beyond disbelief, a quiet, sly & well dressed professional thief is sitting beside you lying in wait, watching your every move, listening to your conversations and waiting to rob you of your belongings as you become further engrossed and relaxed in conversation over food and cocktails with your company, as was my personal experience here on a Friday night! Both Bartenders while shocked and caught off guard themselves did try to help me recover my stolen items but was also quick to admonish me that they couldn't bare responsibility for this! TIP TO THE LADIES.....I recommend all ladies to wear a cross-body bag when coming here to ensure it stays on your person at all times and directly in front of you not swung to the side as a precaution! Do not go to the restroom or step out front without carrying your belongings on you.Cocktails are solid...Food is excellent...Family, Friends and I Love this place, Factory has got it all, chill vibe, they are missing the nice lounge chairs though, but they've got everything else right, nice music selection playing at comfortable levels, cocktails poured with a skilled hand there's strength in these babies with both the appetizers and full dinner dining being on point.

We ordered the wings (buffalo), Brussel sprouts, and the chicken popcorn. Loved the wings-- they give you 4 per order, the best part was the sauce! Super spicy which is shocking for buffalo \u00a0(only because the people I was with hate Super Spicy) I love it so I was happy. Great Sauce! The brussel sprouts are as amazing as everyone has been raving about-- They were that amazing and delicious that we ordered another plate!! Yes if you go with another person just be honest-- Tell them you don't like to share-- They will understand. These brussel sprouts alone get you 30 stars! The popcorn chicken was only made great with my adding the buffalo sauce from the wings-- \u00a0Otherwise I didn't like them.I had the old fashion which is my favorite drink and it's hard to screw up so can't give or take away points for this one-- Not a fan of the other drinks that I tried from my friends-- They were very sweet, not my taste-buds. \u00a0THE REASON I TOOK STARS OFF: 1. YOU NEED BETTER MANAGEMENT! How long does a customer have to wait to be told seat at whatever table you would like. Pay attention to your customers since they are the ones that bring in the business and word of mouth spreads fast. Yelp spreads EVEN Faster! 2. It took even longer for the bus boy to say just grab someone as they are walking around-- So basically you are a restaurant that doesn't go to tables individually? Did you miss Restaurant 101 Class? I think we waited close to 20 mins before someone came-- If we werent set on the sprouts I would have walked out-- The drinks came fast so that helped the situation out.Guess what came faster than the food and drinks-- THE CHECK. It's so funny how quickly they worked to get that extra tip but they forgot about the service leading up to it.The receipt had the suggested tip on the bottom which i like-- Lot easier to calculate. They gave you a suggestion of \u00a010%, 15%, and 20% I believe.

I wouldn't say the colors she came back with were particularly \"close,\" but I turned to my sister who was sitting next to me and asked her which one she liked more, and the girl seemed to be annoyed by me taking the time to do this. Later, I saw that a color that my friend got was much closer to what I was looking for - but that was not offered to me. I think my girl just couldn't be bothered to look around much for a pink. She then continued the manicure - often roughly plowing into my cuticles and causing one of them to bleed - to which she looked up and mumbled something that was maybe an apology? Later, she had filed 1 nail when i asked if i could actually change my mind and have them rounded instead of squared off - she practically rolled her eyes as she went back to the 1 nail she'd already done.

I had an amazing massage there once and a pretty good one about a month after that. I feel like the masseuses rotate a lot, so it's hard to stick with the ones you like. They raised the prices slightly for massages recently, which kinda defeats the point, as there are basically no amenities, unlike going to a spa, or even Equinox. Aesthetic is on point, but a gal also needs substance. Nails seem hit or miss and I am reticent to try, especially since Paintbox is so stellar. I am pretty sensitive to noise and it is hard to relax when you can hear people walking up and down the halls, since the rooms are only little squares separated by canvas.

She also would clean around the cuticle after every coat, making room between cuticle and polish - a look I realize now is not flattering at all and makes it easier for polish to literally fall off. She applied 4 coats - something I've never had before and also now realize makes the polish fall off sooner. I uploaded a photo a week ago of my bad do (original service on 12/22). Since then, my ring finger polish fell off in the shower 3 days ago. And just now, my middle finger just flicked off. This has NEVER happened before. My gels usually last 2+ weeks and then another week of them not looking great - but those first 2 weeks are usually flawless.

We can't avoid that unless we all have unlimited rent budgets! Do I think the Chillhouse space is executed well? I think they did the best they could, so yes. The cafe is in the front when you walk in, the middle area is the nail salon and in the back you have the massage area. But that also doesn't mean you can easily enjoy the space.The cafe has a few tables, but also serves as the main check in area for services. It's cramped when there's multiple people checking in or wanting drinks and food from the Cafe. If you're walking out from the nail area, you can easily hit someone with the door if they're by the cash register. It's not necessarily relaxing to sit there, as there's a lot of people walking in and out and crowding the desk.I've never had my nails done here, but I get massages regularly. The massage space is nice and reminds me of something you may see in another country, very outdoorsy look. I like it, it's cute, the aesthetic works for me. I wish there was an actual room to change in however, as you have to change in and out of your clothes in the massage room itself. After your massage, you do wind up feeling rushed as you scurry to collect your balled up clothes from the tiny table they have to put your items on. It would be more \"chill\", if they had a space where you could dreamily wander off too and take your time putting on your clothes, perhaps wash up, apply makeup, etc. \u00a0The staff - I don't feel like the staff are super friendly but courteous enough. I've never had anyone go out of their way to help me at Chillhouse, but I've also never had anyone royally screw up, so I guess that's good? Average customer service. I don't feel especially welcome when I walk in, but I also don't feel like I'm being rushed out the door. Maybe that's the \"chill\" vibe?Overall, I like this idea and I like this place. I think it has the opportunity to grow (both in physical size and in customer service). I'd say give it a shot, you may wind up liking it and you may not.

I was very excited to get an amazing manicure before mdw weekend and try the highly recommended gold leaf latte.

I watched this happen to other customers while I was getting my manicure. Employees didn't even realize two girls walked in and stood there for 30 seconds not knowing what to do and turned around and walked out. Nail design selection was poor and we later saw on Instagram that the summer collection was coming Tuesday. It would of made more sense to have that collection available for those coming in to get their nails done for mdw. Also nail color choices were limited. I am satisfied with my nail design but my roommates look NOTHING like the photo in the design she picked. We were also told that not all colors in the booklet are not available in gel. (Then why the heck would you show them in the book) and not all designs worked for everyone's nails. I had a partially broken nail and was told they didn't have nail glue (so most likely my $75 manicure will be ruined when the top third my index nail breaks off. Cappuccino machine was broken (totally understand this happens) but we were not even offered coffee, tea, or even a glass of water.

The kids wanted Chinese and Om Wok was suggested to us by the hotel we are staying at so we gave it a go. We used a food delivery app to order and were told that it would take an hour to get to the food to the hotel. Fine, no problem, it's a bit snowy out so we figured it would show between an hour and hour 15. The restaurant is 2.8 miles from the hotel. I threw some crackers at the kids to tide them over and settled into the room. Commence kids jumping on the bed...Hour mark passes, I update the app and I am told the food is out for delivery. Great! Right on time. However, 40 minutes and two bounced out, hungry kids later... still no food. This was beginning to go bad. My husband called the restaurant to find out what was going on. He was rudely spoken to by a worker and told \"2-3 minutes food will be there, we are very busy\" and hung up on. We wait another 20 minutes, no food. Repeat of previous conversation, including being hung up on. So I decided to contact the app to see if we can just cancel the order and go with pizza. Nope, no luck. Apparently when the restaurant put the order into \"out for delivery\" mode it prevented the order from being canceled so now we had to wait. Btw... the app's customer service agent found it odd that it was switched to delivery 5 minuets after ordering. Kids are now crying because they are starving and it's wayyyy past bed time.It is now 10:38, The customer service rep we were dealing with attempted to call and talk to the restaurant on our behalf and was told the same thing we were, right down to being hung up on too. He called back and asked for the business to extend a discount since we ordered at 8:40 and it was going on 11pm with no food and they flat out refused and hung up again. Food finally came, 11:13, it was cold. The fried dumplings were soggy and the general tso chicken was gooey and sauceless. To top it off... there was 1 fortune cookie and 2 kids. Just the icing on the cake. Needless to say, if you can't tell, I am completely turned off by this experience. We informed the hotel of the issue and were told we are not the first guest to complain, but they thought it had been a fluke. They are removing the restaurant from their list of recommendations.To the business: Your carelessness left 2 children extremely hungry and my husband and I very disappointed in your business model.

This drink is almost perfect; I just wish it had 50% less sugar. After having it 3 times, I realize it actually is too sweet. I also got a generous serving of Beef Veggie Thanthuk (Tibetian noodle dish-$7.95). Its kind of like the Italian bow pasta, except not exactly bow shaped; flat dough. Everything was simmered to perfection except for the beef which I found just a bit tough (just slightly tough, not tough enough to choke on). The broth is so rich. This dish comes with bok choy, scallion, carrots, cabbage & radish. I'm not a fan of radish (unless its pickled Korean-style, ex:danmuji) because I don't like the smell & taste but the radish in this dish barely smelled and was kind of jello-like, which I loved. The beef dumplings are good too!The server was very attentive (I was the only customer for a good 20mins).

I told him to find someplace online to deliver. When he showed me Om Woks page, I was skeptical. A purist when it comes to all things food, I went against my initial reaction to run away from a place that does multiple types of cuisine. We ordered the papaya salad, green curry, chicken Tikka, and garlic shrimp. Ordered online, and yes, they have options as to whether you want spicy or not spicy. \u00a0I always laugh at that option, because when we order we have to decide if they will give us \"ethnic spicy\" or \"white spicy.\" I could write a book on the ridiculous white spicy pushed by people who ask for heat but cannot handle it, nor do they understand the options of mild, medium, and hot. I digress...The wait was about 45minutes, and they were right on time delivering. \u00a0After a bite of each item we ordered.. I physically did a slow clap. Much to my surprise my spicy was enjoyably \"ethnic spicy.\" His not spicy was perfect too, with just barely spice enough to taste but not tickle those spicy triggers on the tongue. Papaya salad was good, frankly it was my first time trying it ever, and although I didn't see what the big fuss is about, I enjoyed it. It was light, fresh, and the perfect bite must include a little bit of peanuts. MmGreen curry with chicken, red peppers and bamboo shoots. I did want to note that this green curry is green. A vivid green. Almost an unappetizing green. But the taste is perfect. I ordered spicy (can't remember exactly what levels they had online--i want to say spicy and very spicy, I picked the former). It came with white rice which was perfectly basic, little to no flavor and therefore perfect for soaking up that deliciously nearly fluorescent green curry. \u00a0That green curry is one that I will dream of when I'm not in NYC. Chicken Tikka was good! He got the not spicy, and it was a little sweet. I feel that if he would have gotten spicy it would have been perfect. Nice big hunks of chicken breast coated in Tikka. It too came with white rice. The garlic shrimp (coconut garlic) was very garlicky. There was a bunch of minced garlic at the bottom of the plate. But you order garlic shrimp, don't be offended by garlic. It was great and not soggy despite the 45minute wait.Either way, Om Wok was so surprising and pleasant that I came out of Yelp review retirement to write a review. Yes, I will order again. And yes, I recommend highly. Especially those days when you cannot agree with your significant other what type of food you want.

The fried dumplings were quite tasty, although the sauce on them (both hot and soy) makes the fried skin mostly chewy rather than crunchy (but the unsauced bits were nice and crunchy). The corn on the cob was similarly kind of lackluster; it's advertised as Mexican street corn, but there's barely any sauce and very little cheese, so it's not too different from just eating a salted grilled corn on the cob. We had hot drums, not wings, but they were also not winners. The skin was wonderfully crunchy, but the chicken itself tasted underseasoned with too little sauce. I expect Korean fried chicken to really bring the heat and flavor, but these were shockingly bland aside from the crispy texture.The vibe inside the restaurant is relaxed and friendly, with energetic jazz playing and a woody Americana decor, and the service was quite friendly and responsive; but the bathroom was pretty grim.

Since I was definitely hungry, I decided to order a seaweed salad while I waited. The martini was good, though not the best I have ever had. The seaweed salad was ok, but there was A LOT of sesame oil in the bowl... a LOT, so I only ate about half of it. Now the wings... both had great flavor, but I preferred the spicy. To be honest it was not that spicy to me, and neither were overwhelming with flavor, but it was very light.

Kimchi fried rice was great, no complaints there. The wings were the BOMB. Honestly that's the only word that would come to mind to describe these fried bits of heaven. They were fried to perfection and oh so crispy. Honestly though, next time I would ask for a little more sauce on my wings. I presume that the sauce was compromised to keep the wings as crispy as possible, but it would've been nice to have more of that nice flavoring on there.

However, when the dish arrived, I took a few bites of rice (without pork in them) before my friend discovered that there was still meat in the dish. This could have been a huge problem if I was allergic to pork. We complained to the server who admitted he forgot his memo and asked us if they can remake the dish. We accepted and a larger portion with a fried egg on top came not long afterwards. The server told us he gave this larger portion because of his mistake and my anger was subsided a bit. My friend and I enjoyed the fried rice and the half and half chicken combo we ordered. The chicken was crispy and very flavorful. I was pleased with the experience until we got the check and I saw they charged us the full price of the rice instead of the lunch option that we ordered. I thought that they gave us the larger size to make up for their mistake, but they billed us at the end as if we ordered the regular size. This made me angry once again.

The blend of mayo and gochujang, with the crispness of the potato, made it super addictive to eat.We also ordered different types of wings and I opted for the soy garlic. While the chicken was perfectly crispy, there wasn't really a depth of flavor that amazed me. I was pretty disappointed by this.Also there were 2 other things that affected my rating of the place:-We got a table in the middle towards the back half of the restaurant. At the bottom of the walls on each side are lights placed along the side. Whenever I turned my head, there would be a light on both sides that blinded my view because it was so bright. The only way this was remedied was if someone was sitting near the lights and covered it with their foot or chair. This was not fun when I was turning my head to talk to people.-The waitresses kept taking away the napkins we were using. I totally get that if it looks like you're almost done eating the waitress would take away your dirty napkins. Except that wasn't the case. We were clearly still eating (wing in hand) and the waitress came by and took the napkin out from someone's hand.

It was definitely enough to fill you up so order accordingly to how big your party is.Bulgogi Platter - a small dish of cooked bulgogi. It was nothing special and a bit salty for my taste.

Also, not enough air conditioning there. Other Nepalese places pass off potato filled momos as veg momos (ahem Phayul, Amdo) if they even have veg momos, but the last thing anyone who is vegetarian wants is a mouthful of mashed potato when anything else you get that is vegetarian at a Nepalese place will also be made of potatoes. I love the ones at Lhasa because they are made only of chives, and I am so glad to see the ones at Potala are also only chive. The menu is limited here: just steamed momos, or the two kinds of laphing, or the two kinds of tea that are standard at Nepalese places. The veg momos were delicious and only $5 a steamer. The laphing are spicy; I can handle the heat of the white laphing but I do find their version lacks the garlickyness of Phayul's or Spicy Tibet's. But for $5 a bowl, I will take it. It comes with the chili sauce on top but no other accoutrements such as scallions, garlic or peanuts. I try not to mix it because the chili sauce is lip-numbing and I can only handle so much. (I don't know why they put this on, when the chili sauce is readily available at the counter). I do love a soup momo and they do not offer this, but I was totally pleased and satisfied with the steamed momos.

The New York Yankees vs Toronto Bluejays. We sat behind plate above the legends seats. We we're in the Ford field MVP club seats. These were probably the best seats I've ever had in my experience in the old and new Yankees Stadium. The view of the field and home plate was spectacular. These Ford seats also had a VIP area that had it's own bar, complimentary snacks and soda. They had free popcorn which were super salty, free peanuts, and candy machines.Before the game started, I tried Mighty Quinn's. I usually settle for Jersey Mike's Philly cheese steak because it's quite large and filling. And truthfully, it's not bad, it's comparable to cheese steak from Pat's Steaks. Gooey whiz cheese, very similar taste in my opinion. However, this time I wanted to try something new. I went with Mighty Quinn's burnt ends sandwich. Presentation, it wasn't pretty to look at. It looked like it was made by my elementary school cafeteria staff. The BBQ sauce was too sweet and for a sandwich that's called burnt ends, it had very little burnt taste and texture to it. Some pieces were meaty and some were just all fat. I wouldn't get this sandwich again. Next I tried Yankees Stadium grand slam shakes served in a souvenir cup. I ordered a s'mores shake. It's incredibly sweet, the marshmallows were cold and hard even though the outer part had some burnt ends. The candy coated pretzel was pretty good. The Graham crackers tasted very stale and disgusting when it got wet from the shake. Price of the shake is $14.99 plus tax. Pricey. I wouldn't get that again too. The shake has a weird greasy after taste from the whipped cream. The cup was is extremely oily and hard to clean when I brought it home.The Ford MVP seats were great but be prepared for freeloaders. Everytime you exit your area to go-to the restroom or anywhere, there's a crowd of freeloaders standing by the Ford seats asking if you're leaving so they could have your ticket and take your seats for the remainder of the game. That type of crumb bum atmosphere kinda ruins the experience because it gets really annoying Everytime you wanna get up for the restroom, concessions, gift shop, there's a dozen people just badgering you and asking for your ticket and if you're leaving the stadium or not.

I was a lifelong fan until they spent ridiculous $400 million back in 2007 on contracts for CC Sabathia and AJ Burnett during the financial crisis. But back to the task at hand, new Yankees Stadium....Having been to the old stadium for all my life and then walking into this new park, my first and biggest impression was.....it was nothing but a rebuild and exact model from the original. \u00a0This was extremely disappointing. So as I started walking around and exploring, it felt like nothing had changed. Looking onto the field, I thought in my head, \"eh\" it's just okay. I still wonder to this day why if you're gonna replace such an iconic and historic park, why not remodel the new place to look distinctly different? Nothing will ever compare to old Yankee stadium so this new park should have had its own personality. I felt like that effort failed in my eyes.I will give credit when you first walk into the front entrance of Yankee Stadium, they have a hallway reminding me of columns from a Greek Cathedral. At night it gets all lit up. This was my favorite part of the stadium and was unique. Also, Monument Park was nice to explore but there was a huge line just to get to see it. A nice feature which most of the newly built parks have anyways is.....no matter what section level you're on, they have eye level viewing of the field. So as you are walking, you can stop and see the action without missing much of what's going on.I sat in the upper deck roughly behind home plate. The seats were fine and I had no complaints. But the stadium is huge and unlike some of my favorite ballparks in San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Yankee Stadium did not have that cozy and intimate setting to it. It was built large and left me with the impression that New York has to do things bigger and they're not afraid to admit it.Lastly, the food was fine. Yeah everything is over the top on prices. They now have an NYY Steak restaurant inside the park though why would anyone go to an elegant place like that at a baseball game? I've always gone outside and across the street from the parks to get a couple of slices of pizza for $5. And as you know parking for cars is crazy pricey. It makes no sense....all you have to do is pay a subway fare that'll take you straight to the park from almost anywhere.Unfortunately new Yankee Stadium was a bit of a downer for me. I just wish it didn't remind me so much of the old stadium. But I'm just an average fan and I'm sure for the players and the city of New York, this new park was a blessing in the making and a refreshing update for many.

Besides the Knicks, the only other franchise I've ever followed for more than just a casual period were the Yankees. Last time I was ever even at a baseball game, it was the Yankees.......back in the 80's at the old stadium. I don't remember much about it, but I had heard that this new one was an improvement - though I came in expecting nothing. The area is busy. There are parking options and subway options, depending on whether you mind traffic or not. While it's an easy drive for me, I'd rather avoid the traffic congestion and take the train. There is a good police presence around, so you can feel safe and not let the \"rep\" of this area ruin your experience. Inside is very spacious (all areas but the seats). I can't compare this stadium to any other frankly, but to me, as a baseball stadium it's pretty nice. There is plenty of things to take pictures of and of course plenty of (overpriced) eating and drinking options. Whether you're a baseball fan or not, the Yankee Museum is a must see. There is plenty to look at the it's laid out very nicely. It was a day game I went to, so it wasn't overly crowded when I was there, which is always nice. The actual stadium seats are not that great. For all the hoopla about a new stadium, it would've been nice to have better, more comfortable, and wider seating. I had a friend on my right side and a larger and not smelling so nicely stranger on my left side......needless to say, I felt cramped for most of the game until I decided to relocate my seat and spread out later on. I also walked around for a bit and found that time better than actually sitting for a seat I paid for since it was so uncomfortable. As mentioned, around the 7th inning, I noticed a larger amount of empty seats on the other side and we moved there to spread out. Much more comfortable. I don't expect them to renovate the seats, but it's enough to make me think twice for the next time. I don't care about the uncomfortable seating as much as I do care for the lack of spaces between the seats. As stated, the food and drinks are overpriced as expected, so don't be surprised. There is of course merchandise and a nice store near the exit. If it's later in the game or after the game, they will warn you that you can't go back to the stadium if you enter the Team Shop - so make sure you're completely done with all aspects of the stadium. The store is obviously higher in prices, but from what I saw, there is more than enough nice looking items to appease even the most casual fan. All in all, a place to visit at least once.

Sushi and noodles at a Yankee game, you say? Yes, there is a large Japanese contingent that has followed players like Hideki Matsui and Masahiro Tanaka, so they actually have pretty good sushi and noodles. \u00a0I like the pan fried Tofu noodle bowl, myself. \u00a0The Yankee roll is also pretty good.Memorial Park closes one hour before the game starts, so go early if you want to visit. \u00a0It is located in center field.The Yankees Museum is also fun and always has some neat memorabilia. The pitcher and catcher sculpture with the signed balls is representing Don Larsen's perfect world series game with Yogi Berra catching. They also have Thurman Munson's original locker.When it's hot out, I like to cool down in Steiner Sports near section 114.The photo booth is a waste of time - take real pictures with real backgrounds.Stadium stores are never a good bargain. I have had more luck taking a picture of a barcode of something I like and searching online for a better deal.Phone signals are tough to get when their is a good-sized crowd. There is free stadium wifi, but that is also slow (and probably not secure).Be prepared to shell out quite a bit of money for food. Water is usually $4-5 to start.If you go to the Audi Club, it's all you can eat, and good food, too, but expensive. They only have two seatings and they usually don't work well if you want to see the game in person. The 1893 club is first come - first serve and getting a table is tough. Both clubs require club access on your ticket. Most season plan tickets have this feature now.The Harlem River Lot is the best lot in which to park. \u00a0You can walk right over through the Metro North station and arrive between gates 4 and 6. \u00a0It's easy access if going south on 87. \u00a0Get off at the 153rd st exit and stay left (first bear left going under 87). It will be on your right.The Hudson Line is the only line that does not require a transfer from the 125th St. station. If coming from the north, get on at Croton Harmon or Tarrytown to maximize your return options.Keep an eye out for the subway when you're sitting in the stadium. \u00a0Look out between right and center fields.If you have a CLEAR card, you can use it at Gate 2.Buy tickets using StubHub - they are usually much cheaper than face value tickets (Ticketmaster), especially as you get closer to the game as people are looking to dump their tickets for whatever they can get."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "review": "Do I really need to write a review for Yankee Stadium?

The lines for alcohol were also fast. What blew me away was that there were vendors with ice chests just selling can beer for cash throughout the stadium.

I selected the vegetarian tasting menu for 2 reasons. 1. It looked like it had a lot of things on it I was interested in, and 2. I am not the biggest fan of fish. You may be wondering what I was thinking coming to a pretty well known seafood restaurant, but I knew they had a pretty good vegetarian menu, so I went for it. The first four bites from the kitchen were nice. There were some refreshing bites with cucumber, som very finely cubed beets, a small spring roll with a horseradish sauce that gave it a nice kick, and my favorite, the mushroom fat. It was a little cup of all the good tastes of mushroom. Creamy and amazing.Next came the artichoke course, with a small amount of risotto in the middle, a small shaving of truffle, with a small chip of parsnip and a truffle sauce. It was very clearly painstakingly made and prepared. It was delicious. I do wish there was a tad more risotto, but only because it was good! Next I had poached white asparagus with a garlic parsley emulsion. I was surprised by the lack of the asparagus flavor in this dish. I feel like it was missing something. Also the asparagus was challenging to cut and I ended up having to cut it length wise. Overall not my favorite dish. Next was the black truffle tagliatelle. Divine, as you might imagine. Not much else to say. This was one of the reasons I came, and it didn't disappoint. Next I received a bar snack that was some long chips. They were pretty flavorful, but a tad greasy. Next was the bouillabaisse- Slowly Cooked Mediterranean Vegetable Medley, Anise-Saffron Infused Broth. It was okay. I don't feel strongly positive about this dish. If given the choice, I wouldn't order it again. I should note I don't care for anise, but that wasn't it. It was more the vegetables chosen just weren't anything special.Following that was the curry - Cauliflower Couscous, Romanesco, Okra, Seasonal Vegetables, Madras Curry Stew. This was pretty good! I could have done without the okra due to its slimy texture. But otherwise good!MOREL - Himalayan Morel-Spring Pea-Fava Bean Casserole. Tasted lovely of mushroom as it should have. The fava beans and peas added a nice texture and flavor. COCONUT - Coconut-Calamansi Custard, Sorbet - what a delightful pallet cleanser - or pre dessert as they called it. COFFEE - Coffee Caramel Cr\u00e9meux, Roasted Almond Mousse, Bourbon Froth - this was only okay. Was a bit hard to break into. Overall a solid meal.

Came here on Saturday 3/31 @ 5:30pm for my Dad's birthday. Let start with this: A sommelier actually knocked water all over our table. No sincere apology or offer to switch a table. They just covered it up with a dinner napkin. This put a damper on the night, literally. Let's begin with the service- unapproachable, rushed, cold. The waiter asked us multiple times if we needed more time to review the menu. If your guests are out with their iPhones trying to read the menu (because it's so dim, and because they're old!) then common sense should kick in. My parents are Chinese and culinary terms that are perhaps rudimentary for others aren't for them. We were disappointed the geoduck was out for the night. If that's the case, reprint your menu. Don't disclose this when we're ordering. Tell us prior, please. Once the dishes did actually arrive, the explanations were so damn fast, and when we followed up with questions, the responses were curt and unhelpful.The food was fine, but hard to appreciate when there's been no care in the explanation of the ingredients, sauces, etc. I wasn't impressed with the tableside \"saucing\" they do with every plate. Please put less attention into the theatrics and more into making your customers feel welcomed.I actually think the perfectly cooked langoustine was ruined by the excess of salt. I will say that the lobster was an unforgettable bite. I thought about it for days after. \u00a0The desserts are great, but again, I felt like whatever was served was haphazardly done.. maybe just for our table? The infamous apple dessert's stem was half way falling off. Not a big deal, but when you're shelling out $$$ these are the details that matter. We were actually going to order more, or at least try to, but we were so put off that we left and had a beer elsewhere.We chose the four course option with quite a few cocktails.

For the rest of the meal, he set my utensils accordingly. Not a huge thing, but it was a detail that made my experience that much better. Most of the dishes were seafood, which I am not usually a huge fan of, but I still enjoyed all of them. If you are a seafood person, it's definitely worth a try.

He grumbled quite a bit when we explained our problem but eventually discounted our meal AND offered us free mozzarella sticks to go as a gesture of goodwill, which was appreciated...Just kidding. In actuality, Le Bernardin is impeccably decorated, expertly serviced, and serves up breathtaking food. We were delighted when our server was able to conjure several items for us that were not included on our menu but we saw being enjoyed several tables next to us (although I'm sure we paid for the privilege). I must make special mention of the chocolate apple, which was nothing short of edible art.  It is evident that they strive to hold true to their concept of \"lightly touched\" fish which at times missed the mark for me because while everything was appealing to the eyes, not every offering was equal in flavor intensity that the presentation suggested and which is common to this level of food. Ultimately, Eric Ripert and his team have clearly levied their considerable skill to create a world-class restaurant and it is worth the expense and time to dine here.

Then the bread started coming out and we were off to the races. I got the salmon shashimi, lobster tagliatelle, surf and turf and chocolate forest dessert. Have to say, the tuna and lobster were melt in your mouth delicious, basically the consistency of butter, unreal. The wagyu beef in the surf and turf had a harder crust but was also perhaps the best piece of beef I've ever had. Sooooo very good. The dessert was phenomenal. I had given the restaurant a heads up that I recently got engaged and they were nice enough to give us an extra dessert, the s'mores dish, also fantastic. All told my fianc\u00e9 and I both went with the four course option, got a bottle of wine, and ended up spending about $500 everything included.

Their volcano blast is in my near future!"}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "review": "Nestled in the East Village, Otto's Shrunken Head was a bit of a trek from the nearest train station. \u00a0The streets were nearly empty as we made our way toward our destination. \u00a0We weren't sure what we were looking for, but it was obvious as a glance. \u00a0There, tucked into a building in the middle of the block were neon lights and a window jammed with as many Tiki statues, mugs, and flowers as would fit, blocking the world's ability to determine what evils lurk behind the snarling wooden grotesques; the kind of window that would scare an over protective mother, holding her children a little closer as they pass. \u00a0 Given the packed-to-the-gills look of the window, I expected a flea market of Polynesian memorabilia lining every space that didn't need to host a customer. \u00a0To my surprise, the room was actually quite spacious and organized. \u00a0Bathed in blue light, a sizable bar occupied the prime real estate with a row of rounded booths with tufted red vinyl seats parked to the left. \u00a0Puffer fish, Christmas lights and even the occasional lamp dimly lit the room. All of the walls were covered bamboo-framed beach patterns to set the mood and create a mash up of tropical and rockabilly. \u00a0We were visiting on a Wednesday, and there were only a handful of patrons occupying the barstools. \u00a0Their easy banter with the bartender made us assume that they were regulars, locals. \u00a0Regardless, the bar tender was extremely friendly to a couple of Hoosiers who had made their way to where she hangs her shingle. \u00a0There is no food menu, just a great list of drinks with a healthy focus on Tiki. \u00a0You can order your drink in either the designated Tiki mug or you can be dumb and get it in a pint glass. \u00a0At $14 per drink plus $6 per glass (except the signature glass) if you want to hold onto it, the beverage menu is a pretty good deal. \u00a0Otto's has one signature mug that is made exclusively for them and, I've got to say, it is probably one of my favorites. \u00a0Like the bar itself, it is a great mix of cultures and will sit proudly in our bar. \u00a0The rest of the mugs are pretty commonplace, but a fun mix and there were a couple that we hadn't seen very often so we ended up with three souvenirs, all well wrapped and boxed. \u00a0But what about what's in the mugs? \u00a0Like I said before, this place has no food, so the drinks better be good. \u00a0And they were! \u00a0We ordered a Mai Tai to start things off because this classic is where the bar gets set. \u00a0Honestly, it wasn't the best that I've had, but it was certainly a solid effort with fine flavor and a mellow bite. \u00a0In fact, none of the drinks we ordered that night had a kick that made you think that the woman shaking the ice was anything short of masterful. \u00a0My favorite was the signature drink, Shrunken Head ($25 and you keep the glass or $14 in a pint glass, but come on, this is a bad ass glass). \u00a0I do wish that the drink descriptions would include more of what is in the recipe rather than the general polished wording on the concoction, but given that each was delightful, I'm not going to hold that opinion too strongly.Otto's is definitely worth a trip if you're in the mood for a taste of a different set of islands while you're in Manhattan. \u00a0An excellent blend of cultures in its own melting pot gets thumbs up from me."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "review": "Great dive bar, super nice staff, awesome music, AND you can buy your own tiki mug if you want.

When you order drinks they provide tiki themed cups, but you have to put down a $5 deposit so you can either keep the cups, or get your deposit back. I have heard a lot about the volcano drinks which is $30 and can serve up to four people. I had expected to get buzzed because I always assume they water drinks like this down, but NOPE! I definitely felt good, so my friends and I ordered another volcano. They serve the drink in this big bowl, and in the middle it's on fire (like a volcano...get it? haha).

But honestly how did she know what she had and hadn't touched with all her fingers?? She barely scooped anything off (in my opinion) and when she put new toppings on, it didn't seem like she gave me that many toppings. (I still ate it because I was hungry, but I was pretty grossed out).3. They forgot my seaweed salad and my chili aioli. Had to ask for both. Pro: They have lobster salad as one of their proteins and that's pretty unique! Con: You can only choose one protein unless you want to add more money, whereas most poke places let you have a mix of two without adding more money.Overall, the food here is not bad, I do think it's a bit pricey for the portion size.

I love cauliflower. I expected a savory delicious soup that tasted like cauliflower, pistachio, garlic and everything good in the world. The brought the bowl out and it was MASSIVE, making me more excited. Then I tasted it. Not only did the soup not taste like cauliflower, but it was the SWEETEST soup I had ever had in my life. It tasted like warm vanilla pudding. Me and my girlfriend looked at each other confused because it tasted like dessert which is not what you expect from a savory soup. We called the chef over and asked him if maybe sugar was used accidentally instead of salt, to which he replied he actually turned the sugar DOWN for this batch because he had gotten complaints. WHAT THE HELL DID IT TASTE LIKE BEFORE IF THIS WAS THE LESS SWEET VERSION? We couldn't have more than two bites and sent it back.

We went and finished our dinner at another, reasonably priced, vegan eatery in the area. Plus, I didn't like VITA's seating.

The sauce is really what gave the app all the flavor, and the texture of the avocado complimented it well. The beet tartare was so flavorful it had a natural spicy punch. Loved that! Next time, I would like to try the empanadas. I also tried the mushroom risotto and paella large plates (main entrees) and I prefer the risotto over the paella. Both were great, and my favorite part of the paella was the vegan chorizo that was part of the dish. Usually I'm not a fan of the 'fake' meats, but this one compliments the rest of the dish very well! The mushroom risotto is a MUST because the flavor is really out of this world and it is just the right amount of creamy! The tasting ended with the banana chocolate cake . It had walnuts and chocolate chips on it and I'm honestly such a sucker when it comes to sweets if they involve bananas .

When we tried to order our appetizer we were told that the kitchen didn't have that dish tonight - along with half of the appetizers and one entree. We were not told until we tried to order which dishes the kitchen didn't have that evening. We ended up ordering a salad type dish with lentils, arugula and other veggies. While the salad was very fresh and visually appealing there was no dressing or anything to add some flavor to the dish so it was a bit dry and boring. The two entrees we ordered were the mushroom risotto and the king oyster mushroom scallops. The risotto was by far the best thing i had but did seem out of place on the menu. The king oyster mushroom scallops were good as well but there was nothing special about the dish. the vegetables seemed to just be roasted and nothing done to really make them special. Since we were both quite hungry still after the meal, we order both cheesecakes they offered for dessert - a lavender and lemon. both were very good. The pacing of the meal was a bit off. Our appetizer was shortly followed by our entrees and then we found ourselves waiting around for a bit after we ordered dessert before it was brought to our table. I also feel that the prices or portion sizes need to be adjusted to be better suited. I'm always looking to get the most bang for your buck. I also have seemed to notice a lack of consistency with the food. I know quite a few other vegans that have dined here and all of us had different presentations of the dishes and some of us got garnishes that the others didn't. I'm looking forward to the restaurant working out their kinks and making a return trip. ----UPDATE: i was invited back to try the new menu and see all the changes. The food was good. I definitely saw an improvement. However, the service was absolutely terrible. there were maybe 4 tables of people and 3 waiters and most of the evening i could not locate my waiter at all. We had to track him down to order our appetizers and entrees. When he came to ask us if we wanted to dessert he said there is no printed out menu so we had to look at what was available in the dessert case (totally fine). After we took a glance and figured out what we wanted, our waiter never came back to take our dessert order. We ended up just leaving because we had a show to get too. In addition the pacing of the meal was completely off. Our appetizers and entrees came out at the same time which distributed the meal.

We met the restaurant PR, Luc\u00eda, who was very welcoming and polite. The manager (I don't remember his name) was also very nice and professional. And of course we love the ambience.We ordered three appetizers: the beet tartar, jicama salad, and tempura avocado. The avocado was by far the best tasting dish!! We wanted more! He other two weren't much to write home about, especially the beet one as it tasted like pure beets. For entrees we ordered paella with chorizo, the mushroom soba noodles, and the pesto/Parmesan stroganoff-esque dish (I wish I remembered these specific names from the menu). We LOVED the stroganoff. It was so so good. The manager let us know that it would take a bit longer to prepare so we ordered that in the beginning so it would come with out entrees.The paella was also delicious. My friend thought it needed salt but maybe because she got hers without chorizo since she has a celiac allergy. My other friend said her mushroom soba noodle dish was good but not spectacular. I tried it and it did need a little more flavor.We then topped it off with dessert...3 pieces of cake. Strawberry shortcake, blueberry and lemon, and the chocolate mousse. Oh. My. God. All of them were SOOOO incredibly delicious!!! We are it all and felt happily stuffed. We couldn't decide which was our favorite until we finally decided it was the strawberry shortcake. A few things I would have improved was the service was a little lacking. My friend had to ask a few times for the wine bucket and glasses as it was BYOB. Also there were some plates that were dirty for a while on the table. It wasn't annoying but just something we noticed. We were happy that we didn't have to wait too long for our food.Also I felt that the size of the appetizers vs the size of the entrees were out of balance. The appetizers were so small that we expected the entrees to be not so big, but they turned out to be pretty big sized entrees so it felt off balance.I would love to see Vita succeed as a plant based restaurant, they deserve it and I can tell they are working hard.

Sounds amazing doesn't it! \u00a0However, the food I did order was quite flavorful and tasty. Hubby started with the Empandas Jungle as a small plate selection & it was just great! \u00a0We had Strawberry Pina Colada Smoothies with it, which were only OK. Pina Colada is my favorite frozen drink of all time & my Hubby loves Strawberries. I simply did not taste all those flavors. It was also not a sweet enough drink for me. However, it was cool & refreshing on a hot night. For my small plate selection, I had the Mother of Pearl Barley Salad. For the large plate, the Veggie Paella w/chorizo. Although there was no chorizo in that paella - they must've subbed out some crispy fried mushrooms. Both dishes truly satisfied! I look forward to trying the Paella dish again at an earlier hour. My Hubby had a large plate dish which was essentially a bland Risotto. We do not recall it's name. He did not realize that what he was ordering would be of an oatmeal texture.Thirdly, the last piece of dessert! It was the highlight of our evening!! We shared a slice of Lavender Cheesecake. I am sad, because it was outta this world! \u00a0I would have had another slice to take home, but it really was the last piece of dessert. \u00a0Despite any staffing issues for that night, the food was very good and I can't wait to try them again!!"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "review": "A friend and I had an early dinner here and enjoyed every minute of it!

I came here with a friend for dinner and ordered the tofu / vegetable curry dish. My friend ordered the artichoke salad. And, for dessert we had the Lavender cheesecake. By far the cheesecake was the best dish out of the 3 ordered. The tofu / vegetable curry dish was overpowering in flavors and the ratio of the tofu mixture with rice felt disproportionate. There seemed to be more rice than the curry mixture thus making the dish a bit dry. The artichoke salad was to have crispy artichokes and instead it was more on the mushy side. The salad had more dressing in it thus drenching the salad instead of making it be a fresh delightful dish. The lavender cheesecake - Definitely wouldn't change anything about this dessert. The crust, cheesecake and blueberries were all portioned and presented beautifully. There's a lot of competition in the city as far as vegan food goes - Overall, glad to have had the opportunity to check this place out.Updated review: Attended VITA for a 2nd time on August 3rd and ordered the king oyster scallops and pappardelle dish. Both were good dishes to order and an improvement from the last visit. The king oyster scallops could've used less vinaigrette as that seemed to have drenched certain parts of the plate. The pappardelle could've used slightly more sauce. For dessert, the blueberry lemon cheesecake was not as delicious as the lavender cheesecake. Perfect practice makes perfect so over time and repeated attempts with these recipes, there shall be improvements :)"}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "review": "We got to go to Vita during their soft opening and we were really impressed!

I went with a friend and for appetizers we ordered the Crispy Artichokes and the Zucchini Bloom (stuffed, fried zucchini blossoms). The artichokes and zucchini blossoms on their own were quite tasty, but the weird thing was that they both came piled atop a heap of salad - without any dressing or seasoning. They really were fairly large and undressed bowls of salad, which were just completely dry to eat. We ended up asking for dressing for the salads, which they brought. But it seemed strange for something labeled \"small bites.\" They should have been called salads. Or the artichokes and zucchini blooms should have been served on small plates, with some sauce. The main courses were uneven as well. We shared a Paella and the King Oyster \"Scallop\" dishes. The paella's description sounded delicious but unfortunately was extremely bland. The few slivers of their seitan chorizo on top of the dish were hard and dried out. The rice seemed to have hardly any seasoning at all. The King Oyster dish was more successful, although our favorite parts of the dish were the beluga lentils and the roasted/charred vegetables. The mushrooms themselves which should have been the stars of the dish, tasted like they had been (over)marinated in a vinegar-based dressing and were a bit too tangy for my taste. Our server was very nice and friendly, although curiously inattentive at times, even though there were very few other people in the restaurant. We had to wave him down and call for his attention several times when we needed something. Their desserts were excellent though - we tried the white chocolate cheesecake and a chocolate \"mousse\" that was actually very dense, had a piecrust, and was more like a cheesecake too...another weird labeling issue but we didn't mind that one because it was so delicious. Both cheesecakes were creamy and delicious. Do not skip dessert when you're there! I'm really pulling for this place because the staff is so friendly and it really does have a lot of good things going for it. The outdoor space in the back also has a lot of potential to be a great meetup spot.

Two of us were sharing this one, otherwise I don't think I can finish it due to the oily taste. We also had the King Oyster Scallop. They recommended this one to us, and saying if we used to like seafood, \u00a0we would enjoy this one. Well, it taste nothing like seafood, although I didn't expect the same texture since they use mushroom instead of scallop. It's a pretty dish, but the lettuce in the middle is burned and left a burned smell of the dish. We also tried their white chocolate cheese cake. It taste nothing like cheesecake and overly sweet.

Any more spice, and the coconut milk flavor would have been covered up. The adobo chicken was good. It wasn't as salty as I thought it would be. The flan was a little disappointing though.

Our second \"app\" was an entree size portion of the mushroom ravioli for the table...Oh.My.God. I MAY have licked the plate clean. The brown butter cream sauce with fried sage was such a typically amazing compliment to the earthy hen of the wood mushrooms. The pasta was light and perfectly cooked. Not one bad thing to say.

I also love how they have a small fresh arugula salad on the side. 3) Mushroom ravioli- (it comes in two sizes: small/large) and it's some of the best pasta I've ever had.

Then I got the Tongue hash and I think that was it for me and Mayfield. I've been a local and come here very often and that dish killed it for me. The tongue was so undercooked that it was disgusting. I even swapped plates with my husband and he couldn't stomach it. So--Avoid that plate. They still charged us for it even though the cute server with bangs was told that none of us liked it or could even manage to eat it. This server is great at selling but if someone seems hesitant about tongue--you should probably suggest another meal. On another occasion I ordered two coffees. They brought us a single French press that filled each cup less than halfway--Then they charged us 8 dollars for what was basically a single cup of coffee. What the actual fuck. So--get the kale salad and an Albari\u00f1o and you'll be happy. But don't toy with their attempts at fine dining. They fail there--the steak is great though. Tiny tiny oysters. Hahaha.

I ordered the House Corned Beef Tongue Hash.QualityI was in New York City for the weekend so I was following the lead of my buddies for all food selections. On Saturday afternoon my friend suggested that we try out Mayfield for brunch. It was a bit later in the day so I figured I would be ordering lunch, but as soon as I saw the House Corned Beef Tongue Hash, I knew that would be my selection. A mix of tender meat, potatoes, and veggies with two poached eggs on top, a mustard hollandaise, and rye toast created a delicious mixture. I was not sure how I would feel about the mustard hollandaise, but it turned out to be pretty amazing. The highlight of the meal though was dragging the rye toast through the remains of the bowl and soaking up the delicious juices. I will say that my friend ordered the Patty Melt and I must admit that made me feel like I made the wrong selection.QuantityThe House Corned Beef Tongue Hash comes in a good sized bowl with two pieces of toast on the side. I came in hungry though and I definitely felt like I could have used a side dish to go along with it.ValueAll the prices on the menu seemed pretty reasonable. My dish was about $15, which may be a little high for a breakfast dish, but the unique flavors make it worth that extra few dollars.AmbianceMayfield is located in Brooklyn in an area known as Prospect Heights. Compared to the nearby businesses it has a much more hip and modern feel. Inside you can tell they left much of the original design in place. Red brick and white tiles line the walls and a beautiful wooden floor give it a cool feel. The inside area stretches longways with an open kitchen towards the back and a bar area in the center. It also seemed like that had a small outdoor patio open in the back. They were playing a great mix of indie rock music in the background, which really matched the vibe of the restaurant. Everything was great except the fact that it was unbelievably hot inside. At first we were seated towards the back and we assumed that the heat was coming from the kitchen. We ended up moving closer to the front, where we learned it was actually just obnoxiously hot throughout the entire restaurant. It honestly was hard to enjoy a meal and conversation because of the heat, and the room temperature water didn't help at all either.CrowdThe restaurant was pretty busy for brunch on Saturday afternoon. It was full of couples and small groups of friends having food and drinks. It was a younger crowd and it had a very trendy style.ServiceOur waitress was great and was very charming in her descriptions of the food. Her midwest perspective was endearing and she helped our small group have a good time.ParkingThere was street parking directly in front of the restaurant, but it was a bit of a challenge to get a spot. It took us two laps, but with persistence we were finally able to final sneak into one.ExtraMayfield was a good brunch spot that could have been better if not for how hot the restaurant was. I enjoyed the food, felt that it was reasonably priced, and thoroughly enjoyed the service.

I really liked the menu even though because of dietary restrictions to nuts and pork about half the menu was off limits for me. The kitchen would have been happy to make changes but sometimes substitutions change the whole dynamic of a dish. I ended up having the fried oysters to start which were the best I have ever have. Other restaurants fried oysters are sometimes still slimy but these were crunchy and served with smoked salmon over some kind of slaw. For an entree I had the trout which was honestly pretty disappointing. They de-boned it like experts but the flavor was a bit on dimensional. It was salty and between the pan searing and the fried fingerling potatoes it was a bit oily. I wish there was a fresh or vegetable component added to the dish. That would have taken it up a notch for me. All in all it was still a nice dinner and the service and drinks were spectacular.

Corned beef Hash with a runny egg is a dish I have craved on hung over mornings for over a decade. Normally I would eat it, slumped half way over a diner table with a luke warm coffee, grumbling words to a dining partner in equal hungover pain. That said, it's a tradition I love.

Yet still, I was hungry and painfully hungover, if ever there was a time my diner staple, it was now. I placed my order and nursed my bloody as I awaited what I was sure was disappointed and anger for hipster brunch culture. The bowl arrived and I was pleasantly surprised that at the very least it looked great. My instagram would surely induce a jealousy, even if the meal was not worth of it.

This might be a way of having more seating space and thinning out the crushingly long wait at 089.We started with calamari which was very good. I think it is a basic thing for Italian restaurants to be good at calamari at this point, it's more like: if it's bad, that's a warning sign for the meal ahead.I had probably the weakest dish at the table, a beef marsala. We had some back and forth with the server about rareness. I should have stuck to my guns and kept it as rare, it showed up as medium. It was tasty, I just wanted the beef less cooked.Others got delicious pastas and lasagnes. Service was awesome in general, though the front room seems like a much better place to sit than the back (little less noisy, bartender is super nice, cook hangs out there when it's slow and you can talk to him.) We sat in the back and as the night went on the service got a little frazzled and disjointed but it was no big deal, we weren't in a hurry.Would definitely come back here, you can't really go wrong on Arthur Ave I guess, but this was a pleasant surprise (I guess they lower expectations up front with the name lol.)"}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "review": "We ended up at Fiasco by chance.

Crab - reminded me more of a crab cake. But still wonderful. Definitely more of a summer flavor. Samosa - I expected this to be spicier. It was a little on the blander side.

I was most excited for the philly cheese steak and it was my least favorite. It was a little weird but it's okay. The crab is $1 extra but worth it. The BBQ pork was soooo good!! The cheese and beef were pretty good also. They have a ton of sides which all looked sooo yummy but I only went with the Mac and cheese. Also loved it.

It occurred to me right after looking at the suggested restaurants and their surprisingly good reviews that I needed to account for it being...well, SI. User discretion advised.Customer service is great - I don't eat cows or pigs, and the person at the counter patiently smiled and answered every \"what does this one have\" question of mine. I left with 3 empanadas and a can of Coke (combo of 2 + a soda/water for $5, and an extra). My soda was not the coldest. That's on me - dig further back.Crab: Not good, certainly not worth the $1 extra. It is very salty. I ate this one first, which worked out for the better, so I didn't end up sad and dehydrated. Especially considering it's 90 degrees out right now.Curry chicken: Better. You can taste the spices, and the chicken & veggies seem balanced. I detected fresh cilantro as well?Jerk chicken: Best in terms of flavor, but there is no benefit to having any vegetables in here except making it cheaper to produce for the establishment.They're all quite deep-fried. I enjoyed this, but it's definitely a special level of indulgence - think junk takeout egg roll wrapping, except fresher and a little fluffier. I would likely not make a full meal of these again (back to the mainland Queens for some Mama's thankyouverymuch) but if I'm ever trapped here again and need a snack...maybe 1 will do.

My only gripe was that the beef was a little chewy so I think next time, I would probably order it with shrimp or tofu instead.For drinks, a (sake) cocktail here will run you about $10. I had the grapefruit mojito, which was pretty good (I asked for it less sweet) but could have use a bit more sake in it. Wasn't really worth the $10 IMO, especially since most of it was ice. I bet if they added some happy hour specials, they would probably have more business, especially since there are so many other Thai restaurants (with HH) in the area. Either way, I'd deffo come back for some more of that fried rice."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "review": "Great Thai food for a reasonable price, and they deliver which is always a plus.

Kind of out of the way train wise, so you're less likely to bump into large crowds on a weekend. Me and a friend came here on Friday night with 7pm reservations. Unfortunately they somehow lost or reservation, but luckily for us there were so many seats available anyway that it wasn't an issue. I was seated first and ordered a drink while waiting for my friend to arrive. She arrived, we ordered and my drink was still no where to be seen. 15 min later my mango mojito arrived and I wasn't so annoyed anymore because it was really good! My friend ordered the grapefruit mojito and she enjoyed that as well. They really put elbow grease in making these, so I guess that's why we had to wait so long. There's no happy hour here :( so drinks range from $6 for a beer to $10 for their cocktails. I ordered the shrimp pad see ew ($14) and I really enjoyed it. I would go as far to say it was one of the best pad see ews I've had. Texture of the noodles were smooth and the egg mixture was really flavorful (hey it's the small things that count). They gave 6 pieces of jumbo shrimp which were cooked perfectly, but perhaps could have had a bit more flavor. My friend ordered the basil fried rice with beef; the fried rice was pretty good & spicy but my friend said the beef was kind of tough.When the check came, I saw that they got the bills mixed up and they accidentally charged my card for someone else's bill. They realized soon after and apologized but I'll have to remember to check my cc statement a little closer. All in all, I would come back because the food was good, but it seems they need to work some kinks out since they're still a rather new restaurant, but nothing to really complain about."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "review": "My roommate and I ventured out on a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch and decided to try this spot because it's new and close by.I had the Thai iced tea and the red curry lunch special with spring rolls and soup.

Overall it was a good dish-- not the best calamari I've ever had but it was hot and freshly fried, and the coating was crispy. It went great with the sauce and a touch of lime juice!For my main dish I got the coconut crab curry which was GREAT! It came with a lot of crab meat, which I was delighted to see. I've never had a thai curry like it before so I can't speak to its authenticity, but I thought it was delicious-- not too heavy, but still had nice coconut flavor and it even had a little kick to it. I would have liked more rice with it though, especially since the curry was a little on the soupy side. One of my friends got the drunken noodles with calamari, and I had a taste of it and also thought it was tasty. Another friend had the green curry with chicken-- again, a little on the soupy side, but still pretty decent. I liked my dish better though ;)Overall, I had a lovely experience at Very Thai.

When I opened up the order, I was surprised to see 8 dark brown triangles in place of the thin, flat pancake that I'd been expecting. Mistakenly thinking that I'd gotten an order of fried tofu instead, I called the restaurant asking for a replacement. The lady answering the phone was patient and polite, asking the kitchen staff about my order and apologizing. Turns out I was wrong though - the pancake is indeed made up of thick, triangular slabs with a rice and chive filling inside. My mistake, and the restaurant was incredibly nice about it.Even though all this was handled well, I personally didn't love the pancake. It was very greasy and overall just tasted oily and quite heavy. The chive flavor was more pungent than fragrant. As for the curry, it was good - not great. The flavors weren't as prominent as I'd hoped, though the ingredients - potatoes, peanuts, carrots, onions - were generously portioned. Another thing that bothered me - I ordered the curry with tofu and without contacting me, the chef substituted chicken in instead. While I still enjoyed the dish, I would have appreciated it if they had attempted to notify me about it beforehand. Think of all the vegetarian eaters out there! Overall, a pretty average Thai place.

This NYC spot is all about the healthy, and that worked well as a quick lunch for my girlfriend and I back in the warmer months. The \"Good\" is definitely emphasized here, and so is choice. Search the menu and you'll find mostly salads, but there are enough bases, proteins, premiums, ingredients, and dressings that you probably wouldn't be able to repeat your concocted creation if you tried. Overwhelmed with decision, I flipped the menu to the other side and found some pre-maid choices as well as the premise of a grain bowl. This tickled my health bone (whatever that is) so I selected the Caribbean Bowl. It was made up of black and wild rice, jerk chicken, avocado, mango, tomato, plantain chips, shredded coconut, and a citrus vinaigrette. After one bite, we were jammin' mon! (Sorry) But, it was most definitely a full-flavored and fresh-tasting dish with everything coming together nicely. My girlfriend went for a salad instead and landed on the Good Greek. It consisted of romaine, arugula, shawarma chicken, hummus, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, feta, baked pita chips and cucumber tzatziki. You can say one thing about Good Seed: they don't skimp on what they pack into these things! This salad was also a taste-tacular mixture (for the few bites I was able to steal). The only subpar portion? Pesto Mac and Cheese. There were a few side options and although it didn't sound as healthy as the rest of our grub, it did sound appealing. Unfortunately, there wasn't much to it. No cheese or pesto (or any) flavor really stuck out. Instead, I'll stick to my bowl, thanks. Overall, Good Seed is probably closer to a great seed (saw that coming?). I would most certainly return for some more insane options on salads and bowls. Wanna feel good? Come too, and let the good times grow (okay I'm done)."}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "review": "I have been getting salads here since they first opened and probably have eaten 100 or so.

I asked whether the Brooklyn Shake is supposed to be somewhat thick in consistency or whether it was meant be like a runny liquid? \u00a0The response was priceless....\"it depends on how much ice cream they put in\". \u00a0Genius! \u00a0Needless to say, I returned my winning mixture to the uninterested assistant/server/barista and asked him to rather not sell this excuse of a drink in future. \u00a0Once again, blank stare.

The weekend visit to NYC from Phx had us getting into NYC very late which wasn't an issue for the hotel what so ever. Taxi service from JFK was quick to and from the hotel. I picked the hotel for its location, although having lived in Ireland many years ago and knowing of the Fitzpatrick Hotel Group there made my choice easier. I remembered having heard of their quality so I figured let's give the NYC hotel a whirl. My kids live in Connecticut and another in Philadelphia. The hotel proved to be a perfect location to take the Metro North line to CT and for my son to join us from PA on the train . The NYC subway system is at your fingertips and again so close to the hotel. The room was nicely decorated with an outstanding bath and wonderfully tiled bathroom. Water pressure was excellent. If you try this hotel and I know you will , visit the Irish Pub with is accompanied w/Fitzpatrick's. Serving adult beverages and fine pints of Beers and serving a great menu of food. I was amazed at the Garden Patio Bar which on a Monday afternoon at 4pm was hopping !! Who doesn't love a hopping Irish Bar ?? . I'm a creature of very good service. I've traveled extensively and enjoy quality staff that have an eye for detail. Fitzpatrick's has that. Our flight back to Phx was late on Monday night so we asked about a late check out so we could get the most out of our day in the city. Perfect timing all round. We got back to the hotel at 4pm and decided rather then wait and eat at the airport we'd grab a bite at the bar. French Onion Soup and Classic Cheeseburger \u00a0were outstanding!! Great job Fitzpatrick's. We are already planning to return to NYC in December for the Winter Shopping .

My room was decent, but as I spent my first night in it, I began to notice a number of issues including a window that leaked when it rained, a stained shower curtain, and some mold in the shower grout. I passed my concerns along to the front desk and they were more than accommodating. They put me in a different room with an upgrade, gave me tickets for a free drink and breakfast, and gave me complimentary wifi. The rest of my stay was great, but I do think this hotel could use a deep refresh and the fact that they charge you almost $15 per day for wifi is a bit ridiculous. That said, the staff were all very friendly and helpful.Update: Upon checkout I left my bags with the front desk and picked them up three hours later. At that time, I noticed my umbrella was missing from my backpack and they went and found it in the luggage room. However, right after I left the hotel and was on my way to the airport, I also noticed that my expensive S'well bottle had a large dent in it. I called multiple times throughout the week and was told I'd be called back, but never was. Eventually, someone got back to me and although I was originally told they were finding a way to reimburse me for my damaged item, they changed their minds and said there's nothing they can do. I understand that leaving your bags with the front desk does not make them liable (as they made sure they told me when changing their minds), but this entire process has been very frustrating.

It was clean and cozy. From the pictures I was worried that the door wouldn't have a deadbolt, it did. I was also worried about the bathroom window not being covered, it was. Finally, I was worried about the tiny looking TVs; mine was an adequate size. I slept great. My bed was comfortable, the room cooled quickly, and it was so lovely in the morning to wake up to sun streaming into the room and the bathroom. My complaints are short. 1.

Thank you."}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "10/31/2014", "review": "So, first things first, my stay here was honestly pretty abysmal. Generally awful. No bedbugs or mattress corpses or leaking faucets, sure, but nor did it have the kind of strong customer service and intimate charm you'd expect from a smaller boutique hotel. And yet, I'm still giving it 3 stars, and considering staying here again the next time I'm in NY.Pros:+ No bedbugs! Hooray!+ Conveniently located, not on the \"main drag\" but within easy walking distance of most of the tourist-ish locations+ The late-night bartender was quite friendly and personable, despite the fact that I wandered in barefoot and in pajamas asking him to borrow a bottle opener (not one in the room.) Nicest guy in the whole place.+ The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom, with lovely tile and excellent shower pressure. + That mattress ... holy God. Best. Mattress. EVER.+ Despite their \"shabby-chic\"-ness, the rooms are kept spotlessly clean.+ Managers may not have the power to make things right in the moment, but they're apologetic and sincere. Cons:- Customer service was TERRIBLE. Really, truly awful. Yes, I realize New Yorkers have a reputation for being prickly, but it was beyond the pale. The bellman was extremely rude to my friend, the table service in their pub was bad, I made requests of the concierge that went unfulfilled despite being promised otherwise, I requested a particular room that I didn't get (without explanation), I placed a room service order that was never delivered and by the time I finally got someone on the phone see what was up the kitchen was closed and they couldn't help me, and when I called the front desk to report problems with one of the phones (early in the day) I was hung up on about 4 times. - I wasn't the only one with issues: every time I passed through the lobby, at least one of the desks in the front was engaged in sympathetically listening to a litany of service complaints. On the day I checked out, a small line of nodding strangers had formed behind me.- The rooms are tiny, street-facing, and in less-than-great condition. The TV didn't work and the hot water ran out. Each of the phones in the room either didn't work outright or didn't retrieve voicemails. The place needs $30million in renovations if it wants to be the \"Four Star Experience\" websites like Expedia claim it to be. I've stayed in a LOT of hotels in my life, and if I were using the star system, I'd call it a 2.5 or a 3 star.- Crappy, dirty, slow elevators- Value for the money isn't great. Yes, it's New York, and everything is expensive. But I've stayed in places just as nice (yes, even in that area!) for less money, and nicer places for the same money. NOT worth it unless you are getting a really solid deal from someplace like Priceline. - Expensive WiFi. If a place wants to seem upper-tier, it's tacky to charge you for internet.Verdict: What can I say? Despite all that, the hotel handled things in exactly the way an establishment should. I spoke to the night manager AND the general manager, both of whom were genuinely apologetic (rather than argumentative or defensive) and wanted to help as best they could. The daytime GM gave me her card and offered a free night to \"make it right\" the next time I'm in NYC, then removed all the incidental charges (bar tab, parking) from the room. If I can book on a deal aggregator website so I'm paying for the caliber of what it is, I'd consider coming back, if only for that oh-so-heavenly mattress.As many people as I saw complain, I would expect a small family brand like that would take it all seriously and institute some real changes. I view it with guarded optimism. So maybe ... I don't know, give it a shot?"}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "9/5/2014", "review": "My apt was still occupied when I relocated back to NYC so my fiancee and I had to stay at a hotel a few nights that was convenient for work too.Found the hotels.com rate at $200/night very reasonable for a weekend in March.Would consider it closer to a 3/3.5 star hotel for NYC standards as it hasn't been renovated in a while but pretty well maintained.Front desk was very friendly. Allowed for early check in and late check out. Elevators can be a little slow but there are stairs for easy access.Standard Deluxe rooms have a comfy queen size bed and 280sq ft, which is standard NYC. Clean, no complaints. In evenings, can hear some traffic being on 3rd/4th floor but it dies down since the area is dead on weekends.Complimentary daily access to the neighboring New York Sports Club, just ask the front desk.You won't go hungry in this area since there are tons of delis and always a DuaneReade as backup.The Patio attached to the Wheeltapper is a great outdoor space as well to grab a drink.

The trip was decided upon somewhat last minute, so I was nervous that I wouldn't find a decent hotel in Manhattan. Fortunately, there were still rooms available at the FGC and I was able to snag one at a favorable rate. You cannot beat the location of this hotel. It is right across the street from Grand Central and not far from Duane Reade, Dunkin Donuts, and Starbucks. Upon arriving, you will probably be met at the door by a smiling doorman who will help you carry your bags in. The staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful. We experienced no problems during our stay and found that everyone was willing to help us carry bags, find our airport shuttle, and get a reservation at a great restaurant. Most of them sounded Irish, which was a charming touch of authenticity in the middle of NYC.The lobby is small compared to an American chain, but it felt very welcoming and European to me. The size of the rooms was more than adequate, and I never once heard my neighbors or hall noise during our stay. Both the lobby and the rooms were tastefully decorated and made me feel right at home. If you need a quick bite or drink, check out the Wheeltapper attached to the hotel. We found the food to be decent, the service fast, and a table was easy to grab.

So they give us room 216!? We rang reception and Edwin came up to confirm the noise, he said he will try to locate the noise and get back to us - he never did. Even after travelling 12 hours travelling we didn't sleep much that night, what a nightmare - especially at over $200 per night.The following morning we explained our situation again in reception to another guy (can't remember his name it began with M short brown hair) and he immediately changed our rooms after hearing we were in 216. We had much better sleep after.I've given 2 stars due to our experience on the first night, otherwise I would give 3 stars. It's best asset is location (very central) but for $200+ per night, I will look for a more comfortable stay next time in NYC.

Smiles abound, the staff was extremely courteous, and we were even offered lemonade to drink. (It was delicious, thank you again!) Speaking on the Irish charm of the hotel, there were a few Irish employees - whether they were truly Irish or not, I guess I'll never know - and it did add a little something to our experience of the Fitzpatrick. (Although my boyfriend has a bit of trouble understanding the Irish brogue. ^^;) The staff was really extremely kind and accommodating, and I felt so incredibly taken care of and welcome at the hotel. They held our bags the day we checked out while we explored a bit more before going back home.Our room was quite nice. It had more than enough room for me, a little mini-fridge for storing any leftovers you may bring back from your foodie adventures out, a TV, a large desk that had enough room to work but wasn't so big that it took up much of the room. The bathroom was also large and comfortable. The room WAS rather warm our first night, as I've seen some reviews mention, and there aren't thermostats within the room, but it wasn't an issue the next day.Of course, the location is excellent, as well. A stone's throw from Grand Central Terminal. While the wi-fi isn't free, we seemed to be located on an AT&T hotspot, so I was able to use the internet on my phone without a hitch.

The machine they used to shake it did an amazing job of helping evenly distribute the coldness in the drink.Later in the afternoon, we returned! This time, we wanted to try out their food menu.

Then was cake batter ice cream and pink frosting. Then vanilla cake. Then maybe a little more ice cream but a lot of frosting and sprinkles, followed by more cake and just frosting and sprinkles on the bottom. The first layer of cake was absolutely delicious. Soft and moist having soaked up the ice cream. The following layers after that werent terrible but werent the best. I dont know if my boyfriend and I were sick of it but it tasted very frozen, probably because it was most likely prechilled and the scoops of ice cream were placed after.

All wise life decisions. They also sometimes have guest collaborations. I went in to try a desert in the fall made with dough donuts and their hot buttered rum ice cream. It tasted like eating a huge version of Drake's coffee cakes with heaping amounts of ice cream. I also like the texture of their ice cream.

Considering others have had a similar experience, I really think they need to chill out a bit. I discover half of my favorite places through word-of-mouth. Or, get outlets for the laptop section.

It started out so wonderful and ended in pain, misery, and sadness. I am a huge fan of looking up lesser known or hidden gems in the city and was so excited to visit 49 Monroe when I saw the beautiful photos online. A week later, I dragged my friends over ('dragged' because we skipped/speedwalked 20 mins across Chinatown on the coldest day of the month).Inside, we were met with a charming, welcoming decor that was a mix of secret garden and flea market chic (I sound like such a tool). It was around 7pm on a Saturday night, and the three of us were seated immediately at a whitewashed picnic table that felt private and secluded from other tables. One friend opted for the Moscow Mule with gin ($11), and I had a beer ($8?) - both were great. We immediately ordered the burrata ($7) and calamari served with a slightly spicy marinara sauce ($11). Both arrived so quickly - we were starving so we were closely watching the time - and were flavorful and perfect with the complimentary bread. For entrees, we treated ourselves to the ribeye ($29) - medium rare, of course - and paella ($22). Those also arrived incredibly quickly and were very delicious. The ribeye was perfectly cooked (and I can be a steak snob), well seasoned, and cut like butter. The paella was less traditional in that it was missing the crispy rice on the bottom but made up for it by having very rich, buttery rice that was cooked well. It was topped with lots of mussels, unshelled shrimp, and other seafood. Even though we were ravenous and devoured what we could, there was still food leftover! Given the attentive service, beautiful atmosphere, and delicious, affordable food, I was convinced that I'd found the ultimate hidden gem of NYC when we left.Flash forward to that night: about 6 hours later at 2 AM, I awoke abruptly, shot out of bed, and sprinted blindly (didn't even have time to grab my glasses) to the bathroom. And proceeded to have the most violent vomiting that I'd ever experienced personally or witnessed (and I'm in the medical field). After a gut wrenching, painful 20 minutes, I was mentally and physically exhausted but was grateful it was over. So I gathered myself up (cleaned up, brushed my teeth, lots of mouthwash) and waddled back to bed. For about 7 minutes. Because repeat that scene again - starting from the abrupt wake up to the minty mouthwash. Eight more times over the course of the following four hours.Reaching out to see if my friends survived the night, one said that he had some slight stomach upset, and the other was completely fine. As it turns out, the one who emerged unscathed had not touched the shrimp, and the other had only eaten one. (Full disclosure: I went to town on those crustaceans.) And so, using my lame powers of deduction, given the time course, exposure, and symptomatology, I am pretty sure it was those shrimp. Darn. FOOD: 2/5, would have been 4.5/5ENVIRONMENT: 4.5/5SERVICE: 4/5VALUE: 4.5/5OVERALL: 3/5 (corrected for food poisoning)P.S.

This was really good and set our expectations for the small plates we ordered. It was all downhill from here. First, we were served the steak tartare and the burrata. The steak tartare was good. The burrata was under seasoned. It really had no salt. The tomatoes it was served with were seasoned but the cheese needed salt. Both were served with stale toasted bread. This made me sad because the steak tartare was actually good. Next we had patatas bravas. The aioli was very nice. The potatoes were fried nicely but they lacked seasoning. There was almost no salt. Potatoes need salt. Finally we were presented with the garlic shrimp and the pasta carbonara. The shrimp were tasty and seasoned well, but poorly peeled. With every shrimp we ate we had to spit out pieces of the clear part of the shell. Some still had legs attached. The carbonara was tasty. I wish it was bucatini instead of spaghetti. The sauce was a little seized by the time we received it. I think the timing on the fire wasn't well executed. I don't think I'll go back.

We came super early for a birthday dinner and got serviced right away. They were attentive and accommodating, great sign as we waited expectantly for our drinks and company. I ordered the watermelon margarita, but happily dabbled in the brooklynite, Moscow mule and skate & rye with my gracious buddies... all decent, nothing mind-blowing. Apps- escargot: sorrowfully a miss being that it was not pretty and swimming in a salt bath, barrata- decent and creamy as it should be, mussels done well but minuscule- it looked a lot but would leave a person aching for more and water, the Calamari- highlight of the evening seriously. It was cooked to perfection with a generous panko dusting, hot and fresh off the fryer- definitely the reason if nothing else, to revisit 49 again. Entrees: Rib eye- tender and juicy with a good sear, seafood platter- oversalted although cooked well with the exception of slightly overdone head on large shrimp, what a shame. The Paella, is another reason to revisit. Juicy al dente kernels of rice cooked in butter (a lot of butter) and Parmesan over seafood broth, it was decadent. We all had more or less trouble with the carbonara- I wanted so much to love this, but love is a tricky thing. Way Heavy handed on the pecorino sauce, it was overly salty (a common theme here it seems) saucily cheesy to the point of bitter. It was not good to our party but I am a huge cheese and pasta lover. Sorrowfully I did not love this. The mousse in a jar was so cute and mild- a good ending to a fun-filled evening. To the chocolate addict, it could be much richer but chocolate is chocolate no matter how you slice it. Quite possibly the biggest disappointment to me, personally was the creme brulee. Being that it's my favorite dessert, I do have very high standards when it comes to br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It had the perfect glass top where one had to hit it to break it, I'll give them brownie points for that- but it goes downhill from there. The custard was loose and runny, lacking substance and flavor throughout. I can't, I'm so sad. While beautifully maintained with haphazardly jungle whimsy that is so quintessential NYC style, 49 Monroe aims high but misses the mark by a lot when it comes to food.

More jungle vibes than garden... I think that's why we liked it so much! We ordered the steak tartar, steamed mussels (comes with fries), and a caesar salad with bacon. This was under the small plates section on the menu but it definitely wasn't small! It filled us up real quick. The best part is for the big portion size, the price was very reasonable (steak tartar was only $12)! We also got (3/4 I think) of a bottle of house red wine for only $12.We were completely satisfied from the ambiance, to the food, and the PRICE. It makes going out in NYC so much easier.It is located in an area outside of the hot spots (east/west village) so a bit secluded, but so worth making it down LES/Chinatown. The neighborhood is also changing and there are definitely more hip places to dine and drink.I really can't find one bad thing to comment about this place....

I could barely detect the tequila in my margarita but it was super refreshing nonetheless and came served in a cute mason jar glass.The food came out quickly and I was shocked to see how large the paella was - definitely enough to split between two, and again I'm thankful for other Yelpers' warnings on that. It was loaded with so much seafood.. mussels, clams, shrimp, and two jumbo prawns. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Definitely a winner. The meatballs were also delicious. I was scooping up every last bit of sauce because it was THAT tasty. The meatballs were generously sized and you get 4 in the dish - they are tender and also perfectly seasoned.

Any Peruvian can tell you Crema de Huacatay is GREEN and thicker than a liquid The flavors of the food was sub par. We ordered: Chica Morada: (this is a purple corn drink with a lot of components traditional to peruvians). This was watered down with barely any taste close to a Chicha. Tasted mainly only sugar. Papa Rellena :(which is an appetizer and arrived halfway in the meal). The meat was tough and NOT carne molida. Flavor of the meat was nothing resembling papa Rellena, papa (potatoe)was not seasoned and consistency was tacky/dry .Ceviche Mixto:(the presentation was impractical in a semi-flat plate where a lot of the lime liquid the seafood is in spills out) Flavors were lacking in every wayJalea Mixto: Fried seafood is always good. Could clearly distinguish the quality of seafood usedRocoto: (this is a side hot sauce native to peru) this had not flavor remotely close to a Rocoto. It was literally blended rocoto with no seasoning.Half Pollo la brasa: chicken was dry and barely seasoned, most of the seasoning was on the skin. I was asked 3 separate times if I want the salad that's included with order which I said \"yes \" each time and had to wait until I was halfway through the meal to receive. Arroz Chaufa Mixto: (this is a fried rice with shrimp, chicken and beef ) I wish I tasted it. We never received it due to an honest mistake of one of the waitresses. This is a new business still working through the motions. I clearly heard and saw The Chef yelling at the waitress \u00a0who made the mistake, unprofessional to do so OPENLY. I was mortified for her because she wasnt even our waitress. I will say I saw her more at our table than our actual waitress. The front manager, I believe might be the Co-owner, came over to us and was very respectable and apologized for the mix up of not receiving an ordered item. If they communicate more amongst themselves small details and better workflow could be accomplished. I truly hope to return at a later date to have a better experience."}], "name": "Sabor Machu Picchu", "address": "125 Beach StStaten Island, NY 10304", "price": "$$", "latitude": 40.6291654, "phone": "7182733486"}, {"CAMIS": "50061226", "longitude": -73.7934959, "review": [{"star": 1.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "review": "Customer service?: NopeFood?: NopeDid you get what you wanted?: NopeWould you come back?: NopeNOPE"}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "2/14/2018\n", "review": "Taco Bell.

It is located in a nice residential area, there's a parking lot, as well as relatively ample street parking. Few bus lines go through here (ie: Q12, Q13, and Q27, etc). so it's easily accessible by car and bus.

We split a medium black rice and beans. It came out to like $21 or so and we're on our 2nd serving each with more left. Everything had a nice spice to it and full of flavor. The lady threw 2 griot chunks in my legume which was nice since I didn't want to spend on the goat. It had corn in the legume which I'm not used to but it was still really good. I hope they have crab legume which is my favorite. Literally everything was really good with rich flavor and spice but not just hot.

I also asked why the sushi was lacking in size. She told me no one ever complained about the size before. She said she would make me a new one and send it over I called roughly at 3:15 but by 5:30 therebwas no sign of them. I called back and the lady picks up I give her my info and she puts me on hold. \u00a0A man picks up I explain the situation and he was completely rude about it. Telling me he can't fix my problem and he will not send a new one. I was so appalled by his answer! This is your business fix the problem! I told him thanks for nothing he told me no problem.

One piece fell apart as I tried to grab it. No forks included in the order which was weird...I use chop sticks but a lot of people dont? Won't be ordering from here again.

Another customer came in and placed their order. The cashier who took our order proceeded to take the pizzas out of the oven, pack it and hand it to him. Then he looked at us and asked if we were still waiting. We reminded him of our order. He did apologize and then asked if it was to go again. We told him it was and he put our order in the oven. It wasn't even busy but while we were waiting, he asked a couple more times if ours was to go. There weren't even any customers in between.Additionally, it is cash only.

The artichoke pizza is thicker than your typical Brooklyn slice and was very creamy. I felt a little fat eating it (especially by the end), but it was worth it.

Over the years, I've had such fond memories. \u00a0Late nights in the city were almost always capped with a trip to either here, Halal Guys, or Pomme Frites (the original in the East Village). \u00a0Remember those days, when you end the night in line at one of those places and you happen to run into friends you didn't know were also out that night? \u00a0Sometimes friends you haven't seen in awhile (literally, like friends you haven't seen since middle school back in California). \u00a0That's what made NYC special then, magical even. \u00a0It's because those were the only three spots people went to. \u00a0Now there's a dozen artichokes, a Halal Guys brick/mortar, and the original Pomme Frites burned down tragically. \u00a0Or worse yet, people order in using Uber eats, depriving themselves of such an experience.There are too many artichokes now. \u00a0First they branched to Chelsea, then west village; now everywhere. \u00a0Usually when this happens, it spells the doom for stores - crumbs, magnolia, Grimaldi's. \u00a0The only place that has kept its consistently while expanding is Shake Shack. \u00a0Sadly I don't know if artichoke can be as successful. \u00a0I have my doubts, as I currently see the other locations rack up 3.5 stars or less on Yelp. \u00a0I really hope this place doesn't go down hill.Whenever my last meal in NYC is, it'll probably be here, whether or not they're still what they once were.FYI here is my own personal rating system and ranking list of some other pizza joints in NYC5=worth a trip, something you'll crave4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space1=the place should shut downThe places are listed as best/better first if they share the same rating (I.e.

Metro Feast is a popular Per-Pound-Buffet Restaurant (Pay-Per-Pound-Buffet Restaurant). Metro Feast offers a variety of hot & cold foods. It operates 24/7. The breakfast is $7.45/lb plus tax and the rest of the time is $8.79/lb plus tax. (see my attached photo below for the price sign on display.) They do NOT offer you any discounted price after the peak lunch hour like some of its competitors do in Manhattan, New York. \u00a0 2. LOCATION: Metro Feast is located at the East end of the Livingston Street. It is near the several subway stations such as the Jay Street-Metro Tech subway station (A, C, F, R line. This is what I usually take), Nevins Street (2, 3, 4, 5 line), Hoyt Schemerhorn \u00a0(A, C, G line), DeKalb Ave \u00a0(B, Q, R line). 3. MINI FOOD COURT: Metro Feast is made of the main Per-Pound-Buffet restaurant and three small separate delis (sushi & udon deli, sandwich deli, salad deli). Consider this place as a mini food court, which conveniently operates all the time and all year long for this \"City that never sleep\". For this alone, you can NOT beat the Metro Feast in this area. Also, you must know the restaurants in this very busy and high foot traffic area are all very over priced. So, naturally, the price here is also compatibly high. (Actually it is higher than the competitor's prices in Manhattan.) This area is very specially highly priced area with number of hotels and luxurious high-rise condominiums (and several court buildings) in short walking distances in Brooklyn, New York. Nevertheless, when it comes to the packaged sushi variety here, it is very reasonably priced and my friends love that. (They also sell \"Daifuku-mocha\", which is a traditional and very popular Japanese soft rice cake with the very sweet soft beans inside. I thought you might wanted to know what it is, which sits next to those packaged sushi here.) (See my attached photos below.) The staffs I met here seemed very friendly. They have a very good-looking large full color take-home menu for you, so that you can place delivery orders easily (it says \"Free Delivery\", too). \u00a0 \u00a0 4. SEATING AREA: Metro Feast includes a nice seating area with nicely toned wooden tables. Personally, I love these nice dining tables. They also have seating areas facing outside by the glass windows. (See my attached photos below) Unfortunately, they do not clean these tables after each customers' usages unlike the normal restaurants. So be aware. (see my attached photo) Sadly, a trash and plastic bag were left on the table behind my table. Also, small pieces of breads and rices were all over on my table, too.) 5. FOODS: I enjoyed the hot foods and fresh fruits at the Metro Feast. (see my attached photos below) The sliced pieces of juicy beef were so tender and flavorful. The Italian sausage was out of the world. The chicken & pork dishes were good, too. I enjoy a variety of fruits served here. especially, I love kiwi fruit, so, it was an added bonus here. Sadly, the shrimps among the pasta dish were all so tiny and hard to chew. Also, the fried rice was tasteless, and the wild rice was just too crazy hard. Are you crazy!? (I hope they fix these mess soon. I am a Japanese, who eat rice every day at home, and I am very picky about rice dishes.) Also, I did not see any fried fish or large shrimps here. Personally, I wish this restaurant had more Chinese foods like the other PPBR in Manhattan, with less per pound price (and the after hour discounted price.  6. BATHROOMS: They have separate and well-lit bathrooms in the back. sadly even when I visit there around 5PM, the disposed hand-wiping papers were flooded the trashcan there. \u00a0 If you are in this area, I recommend you Metro Feast. This is where locals go and eat during the busy lunch time. \u00a0NOTE: The photos posted here were taken around 5 PM of rainy Friday, 2018.0427. I really do NOT like the crowded restaurants, especially during the busy peak lunch time. If you agree with me, I recommend you visiting here before 12 noon or after 2PM (although some of the good foods may not be fully refilled at the food stations after the peak lunch time).NOTE: For making my PPBR dining experience truly enjoyable and even special, I bring my own eating utensils, large napkins, and drinking glass. (see my attached photos below here.) Needless to say, I bring my full formal dining sets with over a dozen of eating utensils and drinking glasses to my dinner table at AYCE buffet restaurants.

Both versions have red beans in them so if you love red beans, you will enjoy them. I can taste the matcha flavor in both but for the Black Sesame and Matcha option, I don't really taste the Black Sesame.

It also made perfect sense given the level of precision and detail that is put into their latte art! Seriously, it's so cute that I didn't even want to drink it! My favorite flavor was taro. It was very creamy and smooth. What's interesting about the lattes is that they are served cold, and not hot. While the latte art made it a standout, I probably would not order again given the small serving size - it just reminded me of bubble tea (but without the bubbles).My friends and I also enjoyed their bing soo. Their bing soo comes in two different sizes, which is perfect if you're sharing between two people or more. Their shaved ice was very soft and fluffy!

Third step: choice of 4 mix-ins such as cucumber, hijiki, radish, ginger, edamame, etc. I chose hijiki, ginger, cucumber and jalapeno (because I enjoy spicy food). \u00a0Then, select a sauce (several to choose from and I opted for the spicy citrus).

And Wisefish does a pretty dang good job of bringing you some down-home poke like your parents used to cook (or find flopping around in a field after a rainstorm or something).Their menu is simple: pick one of their ready-made options, or choose among various ingredients that you don't recognize to craft your very own delicacy. I recommend asking the people taking your order what to do - they seem to recognize that not everyone can be a wise fish like themselves, and are happy to provide recommendations. While an apple a day keeps the doctor away, a poke a day has better internal rhyme structure. What were we talking about? Ah yes, apparently this concoction is also relative wholesome - the \"wise\" is good for the mind, the \"fish\" is good for the body, the \"poke\" is good for mispronouncing words. They only have one table, so prepare to meet your neighbors and try to eat non-unattractively."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "review": "Fast casual. Fish is nice and fresh.

The ambience is nice enough and the person taking my order was really sweet and seemed to have a good rapport with people and the regulars. My issue came after I ordered (and tipped) and then proceeded to wait for a latte. It was a bit busy and I stood waiting patiently eating the muffin I ordered. \u00a0After I finished the muffin, I moved a bit closer to the \u00a0area where drinks were being distributed and watched while cups seemed to be lining up ( they looked a bit confused about orders of cups and drinks) and after seeing two women who had ordered after me get their drinks I asked the guy if there was a latte coming up. He looked at me clearly annoyed and said \"yes\". \u00a0Then this guy puts a cup down on the counter, not slamming it but definitely making a louder than normal sound, and says nothing. I stood there not saying anything because I didn't know whose drink that was. Then in the most snarky way he says \"latte\". The two women standing in from of me look back at me with looks of \"What the hell did you do to him?.\" I said \"thank you\" and left. The latte was good but this guy made me feel like I was a giant jerk. I worked as a barista for many years so I would never intentionally make someones day at work crappy. I'm assuming he didn't realize I had been waiting so long and that others after me had received their drinks before me, so to him I was an impatient costumer. What I might suggest in busy times is that they have a better ordering system for making drinks. Not necessarily going the way of Starbucks writing names on cups, but maybe putting numbers or something? I could see the woman helping him moving the cups around in different orders in the line going to him and it didn't seem very organized.

There are a couple reasons why I can't yet give East One five stars. The prices are fairly high - I can easily spend $8-10 on a coffee drink and a pastry. I understand rent is expensive in the neighborhood and it's a big place so I'm willing to give them a pass there. The thing I'm most disappointed about is they changed their hours on Mondays and Tuesdays so they close at 6. They used to be open into the evening and it was a great place to get a happy hour drink.

One pound with drawn butter, lemons, a red bucket with the crab cracker, extra napkins, small fork, and wet napkins which i thought was cool. The only thing missing was a bib. LoL. I had the fried shrimp amd fried calamid in buffalo sauce. Amazing there was about six pieces of shrimp and mixed calamid. The crab came with fries which were so hot and cooked perfect. The service was great. They checked on is a few times. For dessert my girl had the brownie sundae. I had spoon full of warm fresh brownie with vanilla ice cream. It was so good. I had a double espresso with a side of sam booka. Amazing. The bill arrived and we paid and left. It was worth the money. The King Crab Legs were at Market Value which was 43 dollars. Overall we had a great time and will visit again for sure. Great place to go to. \u00a0They have televisions and a few spots at the bar to eat.

The place was empty, maybe because it started snowing, or maybe because it gets more business later in the day, but we still gave it a try. For appetizer we got Zuppa di Mussels with the mild red sauce. Fantastic. The sauce was NOT watered down so it stayed in the mussels as you picked them up. Don't get me started on how good the Italian bread was when you dipped it in the sauce. Oh my. As an entree, my mother got fried calamari and fries. Their calamari is fried to a perfect crisp and the calamari itself is so tender. It was a pleasure to eat. My father got the steak and lobster which he said was very tasty. Seemed to be more than tasty since he left NOTHING on his plate. I got Joes special with red mild sauce. I give the piled high pot a 9 out of 10. But I took home the left overs and plan to devour them in about an hour. The mussels, calamari, and shrimp are cooked to perfection and the sauce really can't be beat. I have ONE criticism, and it's their clams. The clams in my dish (about 5-7) were pretty large in size (actually huge), and very very tough. I proceeded to remove them as I'm picky when it comes to clams. It would have been nice to see some smaller clams as well, they would have been perfect with the rest of the pot.The service was great and no complaints with the atmosphere. On a side note: you may wonder why I gave this place 5 stars if my clams were tough. Well in reality, the pot of seafood I got, could have fed two people easily. So taking out 5-7 clams really didn't make a huge difference in my meal. Quite frankly, everything I had besides the clams was incredible so given than I am unable to give Lobster House Joes a 4.8 out of 5, 5 out 5 seems very suitable.

We had the peach pizza, the beet and goat cheese salad and the mushroom risotto. Beet salad: somehow Bellini managed to miss on this \"I cook on beginner's mode\" recipe. Overcooked beets and watered down, far from fresh goat cheese, third category nuts and a remarkable absence of dressing made up for a rare case of bland beet-goat-nut salad. My nephew manages to kill it every time and he's seven.Peach pizza : Bellini buys canned peaches and then washes them to remove the sweet flavor. Result : watery peaches. Add in the low quality goat cheese, and you might manage to challenge Bellini for the blandness championship. Even the basil leaves were bland. We couldn't believe it. Can you believe it? You can't. \u00a0Mushroom risotto : the menu says it has truffle oil, but it doesn't. The rice is undercooked and under stirred so the rice starch doesn't detach properly from the grain. Also, replacing cream with water might save on production costs but might trigger some bad reviews. An abundance of Parmesan cheese saved the day and managed to take this meal from insulting horse food level to overpriced unsophisticated bowl of rice level.

As someone that prides himself as a bartender, the people running the bar here are hands down the best in Queens. Ordering an Old Fashioned is highly recommended as it is easily the most well balanced drink I have ever had, foregoing using simple syrup and allowing the flavors of the fruit and bitters to compliment the bourbon or Rye of your choice.The choice of Oysters from all over the country are breath taking and I grew up on Coney Island constantly getting fresh daily seafood from my god father's store. The servers are very friendly and well informed about the oysters and almost any drink you could order in existence. I haven't been in a few weeks due to time, but this is an establishment I am proud to have on Ditmars.

From my experience, this place starts to get crowded around 9pm on a Saturday. There are many cocktails to choose from, but I decided to get the Arrive on Thyme.Arrive on Thyme: the base is an earl grey infused rye whiskey. It also has egg whites, so it has foamy top. I couldn't really taste the earl grey, but the drink was herbaceous and slightly fruity. It was pretty sweet and had a slight syrupy texture, which wasn't very appealing. However, it was a decent drink.Overall, their cocktails are good and you will probably need two drinks to get a good buzz.

We went last night for NYE and paid $95 each for a table and an open bar. Overall the evening was very nice. We got served pretty quickly and there was a constant flow of light appetizers. My big gripes of the evening were the music and the service at the end of the night. First of all, the music felt very inappropriate for the type of atmosphere they are trying to convey. That stupid Shaggy song came on at one point. Seriously, Shaggy!? Who controls the music?? Jazz would have been much cooler. Towards the end of the night it became very obvious that they were milking the drink service since it ended at midnight. It literally took us a half hour to get our last drinks. Apparently the bar was \"in the weeds\" but I've worked in the service industry and it wasn't \"that busy\" (they weren't even full) Especially to take a half hour to serve a drink, and not even both of ours. Only I got served... and the server had the audacity to act annoyed. Seriously!? We paid to be there.

However, we were a group of 4 on a Saturday night with maybe 8-10 other patrons in this establishment (not busy AT ALL) and it took almost 20 mins to get our first round of drinks. By the time we got our drinks we ordered a second round because we knew it would be a while as well. Drinks were pretty good, they have a different variety of liquors. They might want to train the server a bit just to give her a refresher on a few brands of liquor they carry. I wanted tequila which is nothing exotic whatsoever and she had no idea what types of tequila they had she kept walking back and forth to and from the bar to check. This does not look good at all. Then when we asked about the oysters, she was unsure of which they had and didn't exactly make them sound appetizing by describing one type of oyster to \"taste like blood.\" I forget her name but she had a big tree tattoo on her forearm.

My favorite bubble tea spot of all time opened a location on Avenue U.First of all, most T-baars are basically hole-in-the-walls and this location is no different.

When you walk in thru the door, the menu basically greets you in the face. Like the spacing, the menu is no different than other locations too. The menu doesn't offer the largest selection, but it's the QUALITY that really counts here! There's bubble teas, hot teas, fresh juices and my favorite, smoothies! Undoubtedly, my favorites are the Red Bean and Matcha Green Tea Smoothie. In terms of the way they make the smoothies, they are absolutely the BEST from any of the bubble tea spots (Kung Fu, Vivi, the many other spots in Chinatown). Yes, I've tried these flavors or variations from various places. The smoothies are not thick, but not liquidity either. They are JUST RIGHT, full of flavor (or sugar for that matter) and contain plenty of beans inside.Bottom line --- whether it's hot, cold outside or I'm full from a meal, I could ALWAYS ... I repeat ALWAYS make room for a Tbaar smoothie."}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "10/29/2016", "review": "I was glad they opened a new bubble tea place on Avenue U, especially because Vivis closed down nearby. Thought it could be something new (not that I've never tried tbaar) but it would be nice to have another bubble tea place besides Kung Fu Tea but I guess I'll just stick with KFT from now on. The first time I had it was when it first opened and there was the BOGO deal for only three specific drinks. I forgot the name of the drink already but I do remember it being overly sweet and the fruits were cut up so small you can use a regular straw for it. According to my friend who has been to this place several times before at different times of the day, they always don't not have bubbles (tapioca)... um should that even be allowed? Opening a bubble tea place with no bubbles, I know you have other toppings but like come on, bubbles is the least you can do and have. It even lists out bubble tea first on its sign! So I went today to get some drinks for that friend and myself, she even warned me. I ordered the three drinks for my friend, two of which she wanted bubbles in it. I even asked the female cashier if there was bubbles today, and she said yes. When I was about to pay, she asked the guy making the drinks and he said no bubble! What a surprise! Actually not that surprised after what my friend told me. She even told me to do 25% sugar for her drink because if you tell them less sugar they just do 75% sugar (also shown on the menu board). Anyways I still ordered the drinks with no bubbles. I ended up getting a taro smoothie with white pearls because once again no bubbles! I asked if I can get less sugar for mine but he said can't do that for smoothies... mine ended up being way too sweet because the white pearls were already really sweet. I had to go home and pour a lot of milk during water into my drink to dilute it. It ended up being a taro milk tea because all that ice melted. I don't know if I should still go back to try something else next time.

I am no expert in Indian desserts, but in general I find them to be on the sweeter side, which is terrific if you have a sweet tooth, but for me the small portions were just ok enough to satisfy the craving, given the technique of soaking some desserts in sugar syrup (reminds me of Turkish or Greek desserts that soak in sugar syrup or honey).

The chicken came in a rosemary Demi-glac\u00e9. \u00a0Rosemary was totally not noticeable. Clearly no fresh. I was excited for the cacciatore sauce, but it didn't taste like anything. It needed white wine or something. The chicken was devoid of any real flavor. My friend ordered the Conchiglioni. We liked how filled they were. But the sauce is bitter (probably pomodoro) and missing depth (herbs and spices).

Worth $18.00 definitely not. My wife had the branzino which was cooked beautifully and she was satisfied with it. I had the sausages with kale and roasted potato. I was very disappointed.

I'm so happy I did.The dish seems small but the pieces of gnocchi themselves are large, almost big enough to cut into quarters.

Reminded me of kazu nori's handrollConger Eel- this piece was quite big and still was warm and has the sweet eel flavor Egg Custard- so fluffy. This reminds of the castella cakes.

By far one of the best omakase places I've tried so far. If you're a drinker, love the sake pairing with it especially ($40 for 6-7 glasses, freaking cheap). They take the time to explain to you the origins and flavors of the sushi and also the sake that's served with it. Each piece of sushi was like eye candy, picture perfect. Get your phone cameras ready lol. Each piece had its own unique mouthful of flavors! Words can't even describe, you just have to go and try it for yourself! You definitely see and taste the art and love in the sushi! It's recommended you use your hands instead of chopsticks to eat your sushi and no soy sauce dipping as it defeats the main purpose of the fresh delicate flavors and texture of the rice and fish. The quality of the rice should be notice as that's where the real experience \u00a0goes and it does not disappoint here. The rice was still warm with flavors that are well balanced. I've been to places where the rice falls apart once you pick it up or the rice is too firm and cold (or even on a bed of ice), or the chef would only emphasize on the fish. Huh?The service was amazing, you feel like a celebrity because they are so attentive. It's $125 for the 21 piece omakase experience and you can feel free to add pieces on top like the waygu beef or caviar sushi or just more uni for extra. All absolutely worth it bc it's so delicious, you want more coming after each mouthful! At the end they serve you hot genmaicha tea and a lychee sorbet (filled with little chunks of lychee) which topped off the whole experience. High quality in food and service!

It's known for being expensive - but also very good. I was talking with some friends about going back to Bohemian, and one of them mentioned we needed to go to Nakazawa first - because none of us had been before. Fast forward, a month in advance I'm on OpenTable making reservations for the four of us. The 7pm time slot was already gone by the time I got on the app at 12:01am. I managed to secure us 6:30pm reservations for a Saturday night in May. Fast forward, the night of the meal. We arrived and were promptly shown to our seats. Their drink sommelier showed up with the drink menu and offered to help each of us, four different times. We all picked our drinks - some of us with assistance and some without. I had a delicious glass of umeshu. The regular omakase will run you $125. They were offering a deluxe omakase that night for $185. It included 3 extra pieces - an A5 Wagyu, a caviar sushi, and an abalone sushi. We went for it. It was worth every penny. No joke. The Waygu was phenomenal. It blew our minds. We started off with three pieces of salmon - one increasingly better than the next. Then came some other fishes - the Spanish mackerel was amazing as was the squid. The tuna course with 5 pieces was out of this world. The chutoro and combo tuna was some of the best tuna I have ever eaten. The uni course featured Santa Barbara and Hokkaido. Both were like an orgasm in your mouth. Our last two pieces were anago and tomago - some sweetness to end the night. Both were really good. You get a cup of hot green tea and a house-made lychee sorbet to end the entire meal. The sorbet was probably the best lychee sorbet I ever had. Service was attentive and our plates were cleared pretty much as soon as we finished each round of sushi.

Nakazawa was one of the few high-end fancy dining that I've gone to in NYC and it was a really wonderful experience, from the moment I stepped in till the end of my meal.Me and my friend reserved bar seating and got their omakase course with three additional pieces (wagyu and two pieces of uni). Uni was a must for us, one was from America region and another was Japan. Although I preferred the uni from Japan, it was more creamier and sweeter as to the American one was more sea tones. I have to say I was a little intimidated by the atmosphere. I'm more used to American fine dining, but this was similar except you were at the bar counter. The waiter would come up to us each time a piece was served to let us know what it was and the ingredients it consisted of. I can't recall every piece but everything was really good. A few of my favorite pieces were the wagyu, uni, unagi, and ootoro. It was nice getting a few warmer pieces in between cold pieces to change up the palette and taste. We also ordered a bottle of Yamamoto Yuzu Omoi, which I think complimented our meal quite nicely as we enjoy more fruiter drinks while still getting a nice buzz. Overall it was an amazing experience. We were really full by the end of the meal. The meal also includes a small scoop of lychee sorbet which was a fantastic finale.

Wagyu was good, A5 piece seared pretty nicely; but personally Im not a fan of the caviar.As soon as you place your order the sushi started very shortly - and no appetizers whatsoever. First course was all SALMON, four pieces to be exact. Not sure if that would be a good way to start but the fish was good. It's not entirely raw but slightly roasted (not sure if that's the correct way to describe it). Second course all white & shell fish, and then red fish like tuna.Overall the fish was above average. However, of the two uni pieces they served, the uni from Hokkaido is clearly not as fresh as the one from CA. You can taste the difference pretty easily. The chef added lots of stuff to the fish to flavor it up but I'd say the best way to do sushi is to preserve the taste of the fish as much as possible. Sometimes the ingredients took over too much that the flavor over shadowed the fish.Overall I would say it is a 3.5 ~ 4 Star, but the minus one was for the service.

We kept our eyes glued to the calendar and booked our reservations exactly 30 days ahead of time right at midnight, so you could only imagine how excited we were. The day finally came and when the sun started to set, we arrived super early for our 7:15pm round (unintendedly). Thankfully, to our advantage, arriving first allowed us to get center seats at the bar with a perfect view of every chef, especially the one who crafted each piece of our omakase that evening. Service was beyond excellent as the head chef would introduce each piece, and then a very attentive waiter would immediately appear by my side ready to answer my barrage of questions. The bar chairs were also very comfortable (important for any 2-hour spectacle) though, oddly, I was taken aback by the seating process, which I would go so far as to deem \"a little violent\". I appreciate the kind gesture of having my chair pushed in but due to the carpet flooring and inevitable friction, the push was rather effortful and it hurt when my knees were banged against the side of the bar! Moving on to the main spectacle - the sushi, they had an interesting concept of serving alternating North American and Japanese fish of the same species, so you really get to compare the two. A bar-exclusive perk we got to experience was the chef flicking the scallop flesh to induce lively twitches, which we were told was due to the freshness and recency of deshelling the scallop minutes before it was served to our plates. Every piece was delicious and lived up to the hype surrounding this restaurant, with some pieces really packing a \"Wow!\" factor owing to the combination of the freshness of the fish and accompanying ingredients such as the shrimp with finger lime or pressed crab meat with a crab innards puree. I found it difficult to pick a favourite of the night, but my boyfriend was dead-set on adorning the wagyu beef as his favourite, which he even ordered a second piece of! Near the end of the meal, their world-famous tamago that took Chef Nakazawa 200 attempts to perfect was introduced by the chef. While we aren't tamago-connoisseurs, the subtly sweet flavour and fluffy texture of the egg came together so well that we were almost convinced we should start exploring tamago in our future sushi adventures (but nah, once you've had the best, you can't look back right?). All things considered, it was an impressive meal that every sushi lover should save up the money to go and try when travelling to NYC. Clearly, there's a premium price tag attached to the experience but for a bar-side show and such high-quality fish, it's worth trying maybe just once. That said, I personally do not feel a desire to come back as I've now had the full experience and instead, would rather look forward to trying the other highly acclaimed sushi options nearby.

Each one was phenomenal and on par with the best sushi we've had in Japan. The sake pairing was the highlight for me, though. They did not skimp here and really brought out phenomenal stuff. The Tedorigawa Yamahai Daiginjo was my favorite, Yamahai being the real deal sake that I fell in love with in Japan. My wife loved the rose sake, Dewatsuru Sakura Emaki. It was a shame because the other eight tables or so in the dining room all paired their sushi with wine. Once we had finished the omakase, I was still a bit hungry, so did a few encore a la carte items: mirugai (giant clam), kohada (Gizzard Shad - silvery fish like mackerel), sawara (Spanish mackerel), and Miyazaki A5 wagyu beef ($13 per piece) - pricey but holy cow! The total bill without tip was $500. Everything was perfect, but having just come from Japan, it was a lot of dough to unload. The sushi was perfect and the sakes were well-curated. Our service was very good and staff were incredibly knowledgeable about the sushi and sake. I think the main reason for 4-stars vs 5 is that it didn't feel like a sushi experience in the dining room. The lighting is very dim, everything is dark, almost everyone smelled of perfume, and dark wine in large stemware was on every table but ours. It felt like a fancy French restaurant and sort of dulled the experience for me. Though the service was excellent, again it was too formal in that regard."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "review": "The absolute best eating experience I have ever had.

I remember being fascinated by the staff's craft and work ethic. Nakazawa used to work at Jiro's 1-Michelin star restaurant in Japan, the one we see flipping omelettes, day in, day out. There's something so commendable about dedicating 10 years of your life to making the perfect piece of tamago (Japanese omelette). I ended up going to Seattle to try a sushi restaurant he worked at, and yet for reasons I don't recall did not order the tamago, the crucial nigiri that he worked so hard to perfect. I had a chance at redemption a few months ago, when I visited his eponymous restaurant in New York. We couldn't score sushi bar seats, which usually get scooped up like hot cakes. If you desperately want these seats you need to reserve exactly a month ahead. We were happy to eat in the dining room, which is about $25 cheaper for the exact same menu. At the time, Nakazawa was busy opening a restaurant in Washington D.C., so he wouldn't have served our sushi anyway. The service was professional and pretty flawless. We took the sake pairing and really enjoyed the booze, even though they upgraded our pairing to premium without warning us (and charged us for it). I didn't expect to be wowed. I love sushi but in the end, nigiri is nigiri. Just fish on a ball of rice. I was so wrong. Nakazawa knows what he's doing. There's just something about wild fish on a bed of perfectly warm, vinegary rice. I had roughly 20 pieces of sushi and each piece melted in my mouth. \u00a0Lots of variety, some I've never tried before and most definitely cannot find in Mtl.

The fact that they require reservations to be made exactly 30 days ahead of time drew me in and definitely made me want to try it more. However, I don't think this place lived up to the hype. The rice tasted bland, very little acidity to it. Maybe they didn't want to over power the taste of the fish, but I wasn't a huge fan of their rice. The fish also tasted pretty plain, none of the pieces wowed me except for the uni and wagyu. They barely use any wasabi or sauce with any piece so you can really taste how fishy the fishes were. There was only one chef preparing omakase for the entire bar, the rest are for show and for the tables so our chef barely spoke to us, except when serving us the piece. I might as well saved $30 per person and sat at the table. Overall, worse omakase restaurant I've been to.

There's definitely some many off days with Sushi Nakazawa and it's not really the best omakase place anymore. We had an amazing time with the head chef who really made the experience fun, but it was difficult to really see what was going on or be involved because there were so many other chefs preparing dishes for the dining table guests. The only memorable items for me were the three different Otoro fish slices and uni. Prime menu item for me. I couldn't handle the amount of food that we got, I was lagging behind with the rest of the group so the head chef knew to slap down less rice for me. Worked out well. Omakase at the bar $150 pp, had two glasses of plum wine. I would also recommend for anyone who is dining to get the sake pairing because it is really really affordable and almost a no brainer when you compare the price of other drinks.

No - the flavor is deep and wonderful, and just generally really amazing curry. I also love adding an abnormal amount of complimentary green onions as well. Do try to spice down if it's your first time here and you aren't a bit of masochist like me. I've seen a tourist come here, turn red after two bites, and have to use a napkin to continuously wipe sweat off his head in front of his SO. He also took a reflective bathroom break.

This place has an interesting decor inside with fancy lights spelling out the word M-I-G-H-T-Y on the wall -- think \"insta-friendly\". There was a bit of a line during a weekday afternoon, but it moves fairly quickly. The first station is where you choose the type of base (rice, quinoa, salad) and protein that you want. They will begin to prepare the bowl as you move to the next station -- toppings. From the way the lines were set up, the first station moved much faster than the second. After the customer in front of me placed her base order, she was still standing in the same area as she waited for the line to move. Next was my turn; the staff was ready for my order but I was not near the front of that station. So I basically had to shout over the customer in front of me (I probably scared her a little since she didn't expect it - if you're reading this, sorry!).I went with one of the classic bowls -- the Manila bowl. It comes with crispy pork belly or grilled chicken, chinese broccoli, bean sprouts, scallions, cripsy garlic, crispy shallots, a poached egg, and adobo sauce. I asked for recommendations between the pork belly or the grilled chicken and was told I could do half-half, so I did. The first few pieces of fried pork belly was good, but eventually got too overwhelming. Even though I only had a half portion, I felt like I had too many pork bellys. Imagine I had gotten an entire order of it! The grilled chicken was good, especially with the adobo sauce, and I didn't get sick of it. Even though I'm Chinese myself, I did not realize chinese broccoli was actually bokchoy. I'd probably skip the bean sprouts next time since it was raw and bland.

I decide to go with the Seoul as I was craving beef and a bit of spice. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised how amazing it was. A little tip is to add the perfectly poached egg. When the egg yolk pops over the rice and beef, it is a party in your mouth. A little bit of spice from the kimchi, a little bit of sweet from gochujang, a little bit of crunch from the sprouts and cucumber, and the creaminess from the egg yolk. What I also love is the scallions and I am very pleased that these are the ones you see at Korean shops. You can that extra crisp and freshness.

A dish not on the menu my first visit is the Grilled Octopus with braised red cabbage and fried black rice. Simply put, it was delicious. Perfect balance of ingredients and wonderfully complimentary to each other. Not a single grain of rice was left on the plate and I hope it will be on the menu when I return in the Fall. Next came the Sea Bass tartar. The sauce in which it is prepared is incredible, fish as fresh as can be and the contrasting crunch of the Daikon, a perfect balance to the bass. I completed my meal with arguably the BEST shrimp and grits I have eaten. This preparation will give any southern kitchen a run for it's money as the grits were wonderfully creamy and buttery and topped with head on shrimp, cooked to the perfect point of texture, feeling the 'snap' as you bite into it. Despite my being so full I felt ready to burst, I could not leave anything on the plate. While the patrons sitting at the bar seemed to enjoy the craft cocktails, I prefer wine and deferred to the very knowledgeable bartender Ericker, to select my By the Glass pairings. After asking me a question or two as to my preferences and choice of meals, he chose two varieties, one a traditional French Sauvignon Blanc with the second, a less filtered, \"longer on the skin\" Napa Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious. It was my first tasting experience for this style and one I will definitely add to my list.Portion to price ratio is good and both wines were reasonably priced, especially for Manhattan. While NYC has some of the best seafood restaurants globally, Gloria brings the added pleasure of a culinary experience, not just presenting a great piece of fish. Plus with emphasis on fresh, I like that the menu changes and give us diners new options and new ideas. You can taste the creativity and why I will definitely add to my 'go to' locations when in town."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "review": "I have been to a lot of the best restaurants in NY and SF and this place does not disappoint.

We were staying nearby and had read several reviews/spotlights on this newer restaurant - all signs pointed to giving it a try and that we wouldn't be disappointed. I must say, it was the biggest disappoint of our recent trip. The service from the beginning was poor and we felt as if we were troubling the waiter throughout. The food was mediocre at best. The jalape\u00f1o cornbread lacked flavor and was dry. The crab starter was decent. The monkfish was flavorful but served at the odd \"warm\" temperature that seems lost in the range of hot to intentionally cold. We were never asked if we wanted a second drink, after they set empty for sometime. Others around us seemed to be having similar bizarre service. The space is nice enough. The tables are quite close together but as to be expected in NYC, only unfortunate when you are positioned next to a particularly loud and opinionated group. I would not try again, nor would I recommend to any friends or family traveling."}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "review": "My friend took me here recently. It's a small place. Somewhat limited menu. We ordered the cornbread, octopus, wild mushrooms, scallops, monkfish, and a couple of drinks and desserts. We shared everything. Cornbread was ok nothing special. Octopus was good, tiny portion. Wild mushrooms good but nothing special. Scallops were ruined by the excessive acidity. The monkfish was the only thing that was done perfectly. Fresh and delish. I ordered a cocktail which was the tiniest cocktail ever for $15. It was less than a full sized drink. My friend's glass of wine was very small as well. I don't recall which desserts we ordered because it was not memorable. Obviously, at certain types of restaurants portions tend to be tiny. But I really feel like u don't get ur money's worth here. Especially when nothing is really that amazing."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "review": "Excellent overall experience. Fresh fish, really great cornbread (must try), other ingredients were fresh too, with really great execution. The seasoning is just right (I tend to find the seasoning at some of the fine dining places in the city to be a bit too much at times.) The ingredient combos and execution are fresh and brilliant, but the chef does not try to overdo novel combinations like some other \"new American\" restaurants might. I appreciate moderation on my dishes - overdoing new weird things can mess up the whole thing. Gloria establishes a perfect balance between novel and safe. (For example, beets with some sort of miso goes beyond the standard beets antipasto with just a few carefully selected ingredients.)Service was really great. Staff was attentive, but not pushy, overbearing, or annoying. They left my table alone mostly, but I knew they were paying attention because I never had trouble getting more drinks, the bill, or whatever. I was there for a while (I eat slowly) but the staff did not try to clear our plates or to shove the bill in our face when we were not ready. I went on a Friday evening (or Saturday?) but it was not too loud. It got a bit louder at peak time (7-8 ish?) but generally very tolerable noise level. I like to have conversations without having to shout, so this aspect was very much appreciated. I don't give out five stars easily. This place definitely deserves them though. I will be back for sure."}, {"star": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "review": "Delicious food, but the appetizers are a lot stronger than entrees here. The warm crab is insanely addictive. The octopus was also delicious, but the scallop crudo got a bit too rich towards the end. I enjoyed the spanish mackerel by drenching it in the rich creamy sauce, which was just enough to cover the fishiness. Both the monkfish and the cod were just fine. The lemon meringue tarte was unbelievably good, but the texture of the panna cotta is too watery. The only major complaint I have is regarding the service, which is not only slow but also abrupt - the server kept bumping into my purse without any kind of apologies, and gave our table a lot less attention than others that ordered beverages."}, {"star": 3.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "review": "I wanted to really really love this place and I'm hoping maybe it was just an off night for GLORIA. \u00a0Given the all star cast in the kitchen, I thought my night at the restaurant before the theatre was going to be one to remember. \u00a0Unfortunately it fell short.The pre fix list was just about everything I would have ordered from the main menu so I was excited.

The jalape\u00f1os gave good flavor, but didn't overpower the bread. It was nicely browned outside and moist inside.-crab: Oh. My. Goodness. So tasty. We pretty much licked the plate clean.-mushrooms: I LOVE mushrooms and these didn't disappoint. They were tender and flavorful, and the dashi broth was an excellent addition.-monkfish: great texture and the caramelized onion broth was to die for. Again, pretty much licked the plate clean.-mackerel: also tasty, but since it's an oilier fish, it has a stronger flavor. The squid ink and cauliflower were a good combination.-panna cotta: great way to close out the meal.

The menu - both food and wine - is too limited, the portions are too small, the spacing between courses too long and the service is sub par. We had the cornbread (it's the only bread option and, really, only starch on the whole menu) - it was fine but not great. The starters are small (the guy next to me had to order two) and fairly uninspired (for instance, a bowl of lightly saut\u00e9ed mushrooms in a mild broth with chives). The main courses - there are about 4 or 5 choices - are equally small and all slightly unusual seafood options (in other words, no salmon, cod or halibut here - think tile fish, skate wing, whole snapper), except for one that is just beans. The small fish portions tasted great and were cooked properly but the accompanying spears of asparagus in one dish were undercooked and cold. This is a small restaurant - about 8 tables and 8 seats at the bar and has a very limited menu of small and simple dishes that require little preparation. So, it's perplexing why it takes 30-45 minutes to get each course out. And, although the very casual and uninformed staff (the woman who delivered our main courses not only placed them in the wrong spots on the table but also described them as the same fish, when they were actually two different entrees) were mostly friendly, they seemed frenzied and disorganized. Rather than refilling drinks and taking orders, the bartender spent most of the evening stocking shelves with clean plates and glasses from the kitchen and delivering drink orders to the dining room.

Gloria, which opened this spring at the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood which is not really known for a strong roster of restaurants, has been on my radar for a while and when my wife Jun's friend and her husband visited from out of town, I used that occasion to finally visit the restaurant. Overall, there were some really delicious dishes that would lead to a satisfying meal.Chef Diego Garcia previously worked at Contra known to inventive and affordable tasting menus, and his background definitely shows in the sophistication of various dishes we were able to sample. I found the colorful tilefish tartare with watermelon radish and jalapeno a bit too bland, but found crab with kohlrabi and bouillabaisse sabayon to be quite interesting in the complexity of flavor and texture (although Jun thought the seasoning was a little too potent for her taste). My favorite appetizer was, however, octopus accompanied by red cabbage and black rice. The octopus was gently cooked to near perfection and worked harmoniously with cabbage and black rice for quite a well-balanced dish. There were some stars in the main dish options as well. Everyone liked the whole wild red snapper that was aptly cooked with moderate level of seasoning (you can always adjust the level with garlic scape lobster sauce on the side), and the otherwise plain-looking wild striped bass with asparagus and red wine b\u00e9arnaise offered a pleasant surprise in its optimal level of texture. On the other hand, whole shrimp and cortez sauce was pedestrian despite its colorful display. The desserts at Gloria are not to be missed. Jun was a huge fan of corn panna cotta with blackberry and corn flake brittle that was quite delightful without being overly sweet, and the summer tart with vanilla custard and market berries was also very good. Getting a reservation at Gloria wasn't too difficult but the dining space is not too big, so booking in advance is recommended.

Really, it doesn't matter what sauce you get, because you should be dumping their house hot sauce BONfire on top of it all anyway. The stuff is money, and they sell bottles so you can take it to go. I've taken it to go. The staff is pretty nice, but they are scared to offer you recommendations on what sauces pair best with what proteins, lest you disagree, and they don't appreciate it when you tell them they are spelling banh mi wrong.

They claim food is viet inspired but it's not even close to vietnamese flavor. Tossing together a random base, meat, and raw veggies isn't going to cut it. Please do not claim your food is vietnamese/asian inspired just because your sandwhich is on a baguette. It takes a lot more than a baguette to call it vietnamese inspired. Major missing components include pickled daikon & carrots, cha, grilled pork, creamy mayo etc. Shredding raw carrots doesn't not equal pickled daikon. And how can you not have classic cha headcheese and p\u00e2t\u00e9 sandwhiches??This is definitely more americanized and in almost no way viet. $10+ dollars for a lame sandwhich? No thanks.

While I enjoyed the individual ingredients, the flavor combinations just didn't make sense. I love sweet coconut rice but the combination of sweet/cinnamon did not mesh well with the pickled veggies. It took some serious effort to try to look past that, and ultimately, I ended up giving up on the bowl entirely. 2. The execution was seriously lacking. Everything was chucked in with little care. 3.

It's a Vietnamese \"build-your-own-bowl\" place similar to poke places. If you're accustomed to Vietnamese dishes, then I would recommend building your bowl with the half salad, and half jasmine rice and quinoa as your base for two reasons.(1) They're pretty generous with the base. I found that having just one type of base was too overwhelming and that it's better to split it in half so you're not filled with carbs within minutes of digging in.(2) Ever heard of xoi/Vietnamese sticky rice? The jasmine rice and quinoa base tasted exactly as though you were being served that as your base. This was odd to me but an interesting take on it because I never looked as xoi as being savory but more so sweet. It wasn't the greatest but I recommend trying if it's your first time here for the experience.For your filling, the 18-hour beef was well worth it. Super soft and well marinated.The place did an A+ job decorating the interior and the service was relatively friendly so I'm giving it 4-stars. My experience didn't quite have me wanting to go back and I haven't had cravings to go back since either.

The 5 spice chicken is very flavorful and the banh mi bread was not traditional, but I didn't dislike it. \u00a0The bread was softer, chewier and not as crunchy. \u00a0I usually like crunchy baguette bread, but this one was a nice contrast since it didn't hurt your mouth when you ate it. \u00a0Overall, I would say the banh mi is pretty decent.RICE+QUINOA MIX - this was very good and highly recommended. \u00a0It is cooked in coconut milk so it has a bit of a coconut-y taste but nothing overwhelming (I don't even like coconut). \u00a0The mix makes it feel a little healthier and gives it a slightly soft and fluffy texture.SOUP NOODLE - I call this the \"pho\" version even though it's a little different. \u00a0They cook the noodles directly in front of you and then build your bowl. \u00a0I would suggest not adding a sauce to it (even though you definitely can!). \u00a0Husband got the bonmi sauce and it was just too many flavors that were overpowering the soup.SAUCES - lots of sauces to choose from, I like the they write the flavors on the pillar next to the ordering area but some of the sauces have too many spices and flavorings going on. \u00a0It's hard to explain, but when I took a bite of my meal with a huge glob of sauce my mouth was a little overwhelmed. \u00a0The meat usually has it's own flavor already, so coupled with the sauce its a bit much. \u00a0Maybe ask for it on the, side, ask for a lighter sauce or mix it well before eating. \u00a0I think so far my favorite sauce is the lemongrass. \u00a0I didn't like the 5 spice sauce that much and the bonmi is decent but too flavorful.MEATS - all of their meats are cooked sous vide so that's interesting. \u00a0The 18 hour beef is tender but tastes like shredded short rib or beef that you eat in a stew. \u00a0If that's your thing then you'll like it but I don't like that kind of stringy beef. \u00a0I got the pork belly and it was very good. \u00a0Well seasoned with the right amount of fat. \u00a0For those being price conscious, the five spice chicken is a good option but remember that it has a lot of flavor already.Overall, I like the concept of building or customizing your own meal. \u00a0They have a lot of gluten free options (and sauces) and vegan as well so it caters to the modern restaurant goer. \u00a0The flavors are definitely good - just be sure to think carefully about what ingredients you put in your meal."}, {"star": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "review": "Vietnamese take on chipotle (customizable bowls and sandwiches).Came here for an event and tried out a few items, namely the chicken ban mi, mushroom ban mi, spring/summer rolls with peanut sauce, chicken and vermicelli cold salad, warm noodle bowl with garlic broth and a vermicelli noodle bowl both topped with 18 hour slow cooked beef.

Doesn't make sense. It doesn't even get tossed -- everything is piled on top of each other. Over priced and underwhelming. I got sick about 30 minutes after eating there (mind you, my stomach is a TANK).It was so dead when I went in on a Friday afternoon...... now I know why.
